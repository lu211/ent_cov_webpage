[{"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170718000210/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39732845": "As the presidency of { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] approaches the six-month mark, find out which foreign leaders { he } [ Donald Trump ] has met or called since taking office, as well as the countries { he } [ Donald Trump ] has mentioned in his { tweets } [ Twitter ].Afghanistan has been near the top of every { president } [ President of Afghanistan ]'s in-tray since { US } [ United States ] forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly described the war in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] as a \"disaster\" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so { US } [ United States ] troops out of the country. But after a phone call with his { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] counterpart { Ashraf Ghani } [ Ashraf Ghani ] in December, officials in { Kabul } [ Kabul ] said President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had agreed to consider bolstering the US contingent there. The { US } [ United States ] has taken significant military action there in recent weeks and reportedly plans to send nearly 4,000 additional { US } [ United States ] troops, according to an { AP } [ Associated Press ] report last month.On the 12 April, the { US } [ United States ] used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]'s border with { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] that was said to have been used by the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS).Around 100 { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised his armed forces for \"another successful job\". { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in { Kabul } [ Kabul ], but former President { Hamid Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ] said the country should not be used as a \"testing ground for new and dangerous weapons\". Although Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has only spoken to { President } [ President of Afghanistan ] { Ghani } [ Ashraf Ghani ] once since coming into office, he has said that he intends to meet with his { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] counterpart in the near future. What will { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] do about { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]? {Argentina } [ Argentina ]'s President { Mauricio Macri } [ Mauricio Macri ] is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s { New York } [ New York City ].That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr { Macri } [ Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Macri ] called the { US } [ United States ] { president-elect } [ President-elect of the United States ] last November to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in { Argentina } [ Argentina ], Mr Trump asked the { Argentine } [ Argentina ] for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in { Buenos Aires } [ Buenos Aires ] - a claim both men denied. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr { Macri } [ Rodrigo Macri ] to the { White House } [ White House ], and he is the last leader to meet him in person during his { first 100 days } [ First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency ].Australia has been one of { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the { US } [ United States ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] entered the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ White House ] Mr Trump was said to have had a \"contentious\" phone call with Prime Minister { Malcolm Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into { Australia } [ Australia ]. A { Washington Post } [ The Washington Post ] report said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the { refugee } [ Refugee ] agreement as \"the worst deal ever\". President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who later publicly criticised the deal as \"dumb\", insisted the phone call had been \"civil\" while Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] said it was a \"very frank and forthright\" conversation.The deal for the refugees, who are said to be mostly from { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], appears to be going ahead with US { Homeland Security } [ United States Department of Homeland Security ] and { State Department } [ United States Department of State ] officials currently examining their cases.Last month footage (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-40284188) leaked to the media showing Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] poking fun at his { US } [ United States ] counterpart at a dinner for media.  Both { US } [ United States ] and { Australia } [ Australia ] dismissed the incident as harmless fun.Canadian Prime Minister { Justin Trudeau } [ Justin Trudeau ] is one of only a dozen or so world leaders to have visited the { White House } [ White House ] under { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he'll be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the { White House } [ White House ] would only be making \"tweaks\" to its relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. \"We have a very outstanding trade relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. We'll be tweaking it. { We } [ United States ]'ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of { our } [ United States ] countries,\" { Mr } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said after their meeting. Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ], meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting { refugees } [ Refugee ], but said the \"last thing { Canadians } [ Canada ] expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves\".Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ] said he was \"very pleased\" when Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s granted TransCanada Corp the permits to build the { Keystone XL } [ Keystone Pipeline ] pipeline, which his predecessor had blocked. That could prove to be a challenge should the two countries enter { NAFTA } [ North American Free Trade Agreement ] negotiations as Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has suggested. The mood soured somewhat a few weeks later when Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attacked { Canada } [ Canada ] {'s } [ Canada ] protectionist dairy practices, labelling it a \"disgrace\" and prompting a fiery retort from Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ].But in a { tweet } [ Twitter ] marking { Canada } [ Canada ]'s 150th anniversary, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] referred to his { Canadian } [ Canada ] counterpart as his \"new found friend\".Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] mentioned { China } [ China ] so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a { meme } [ Meme ]. He repeatedly called the { Communist } [ Communism ] state a \"currency manipulator\" and even accused them of \"raping\" the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] They want to overtake us and if we don't get smart and tough soon, they will.\"But just a few months into his presidency, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] welcomed { Chinese } [ China ] President { Xi Jinping } [ Xi Jinping ] to his { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] with open arms and described the pair's relationship as \"outstanding\". He decided against taking { China } [ China ]'s leader for a round of { golf } [ Golf ] though - Mr Xi has shut down several { golf } [ Golf ] courses since coming into power and banned the { Communist Party } [ Communist Party of China ]'s 88 million members from teeing off. The { White House } [ White House ] released few details about the pair's discussions but the meeting appeared to go well. \"I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\" an optimistic Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters. A few days later he tweeted: \"Why would I call { China } [ China ] a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the { North Korean } [ North Korea ] problem? We will see what happens!\"  But Mr Trump's positive outlook on { China } [ China ] again hardened in June, when he expressed frustration that { China } [ China ] was not doing more to curb { North } [ North Korea ] nuclear ambitions.China, which is { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s main economic ally, and { Russia } [ Russia ] have urged { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] to halt its ballistic missile programme in exchange while also calling for the US and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] to suspend their large-scale military exercises in the region.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to empathise with { China } [ China ], tweeting on 20 June: \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President { Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] & { China } [ China ] to help with { North Korea } [ North Korea ], it has not worked out. At least I know { China } [ China ] tried!\" But the { White House } [ White House ] later angered { Beijing } [ China ] by imposing sanctions on { Chinese } [ China ] businesses that it claimed did business with { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and agreed to new arms sales to { Taiwan } [ Taiwan ].In early July, he expressed impatience with { China } [ China ] after { North Korea } [ North Korea ] launched an { intercontinental ballistic missile } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] {. } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] He tweeted: \"Perhaps { China } [ China ] will put a heavy move on { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and end this nonsense once and for all!\"But when the two world leaders met again at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Germany } [ Germany ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] struck a more conciliatory tone. { \"It's an honour to have you as a friend } [ Friendship ] {,\" he } [ George Harrison ] told { Mr Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] {. } [ George Harrison ] \"As far as { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other.Colombian President { Juan Manuel Santos } [ Juan Manuel Santos ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] in May and had previously spoken to his { US } [ United States ] counterpart twice by phone since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took office.The first call came in mid-February, with the pair discussing the { Colombian } [ Colombia ] government's { peace process } [ Colombian peace process ] with the { Farc } [ Farc ] rebel group. President { Santos } [ Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo ] was no doubt eager for signs that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] will back a promise by his predecessor to ask the { US Congress } [ United States Congress ] for more than $450 million in aid to help fund that peace process. { Although } [ List of White House press conferences ] the { White House } [ White House ] readout didn't mention those funds, it did say { Colombia } [ Colombia ] is \"one of our strongest allies in the { Western Hemisphere } [ Western Hemisphere ] {\". } [ Western Hemisphere ] The second call came in early April, when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rang to express his condolences for devastation caused by { mudslides } [ 2017 Puerto Rico mudslides ] in the country.Their first official meeting at the { White House } [ White House ] came in May after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former { Colombian } [ Colombia ] presidents, { Alvaro Uribe } [ \u00c1lvaro Uribe ] and { Andres Pastrana } [ Andr\u00e9s Pastrana ]. The { White House } [ White House ] brushed off the claims, saying the two former { Colombian } [ Colombia ] leaders were invited to the president's { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he was \"cancelling\" President { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] deal to thaw relations with { Cuba } [ Cuba ], saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor {. } [ Barack Obama ] But the { president } [ President of the United States ]'s approach has not scrapped all of the { Obama-era } [ Presidency of Barack Obama ] policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their { embassies } [ Diplomatic mission ] open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and { US } [ United States ] tourists can still return home with { Cuban } [ Cuba ] goods. During a speech in { Miami } [ Miami ]'s { Little Havana } [ Little Havana ] neighbourhood, where Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the \"brutal\" { Castro } [ Fidel Castro ] government as \"terrible\" and \"misguided\".He said the { US } [ United States ] would not lift sanctions on { Cuba } [ Cuba ] until \"all political prisoners are freed\" and vowed to \"help the { Cuban } [ Cuba ] people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives\".Danish Prime Minister { Lars Lokke Rasmussen } [ Lars Lokke Rasmussen ] is one of roughly a dozen world leaders to have met { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. Their talks at the end of March focused on the future of the { Nato } [ NATO ] alliance and President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] \"urged\" the { Danish } [ Denmark ] leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.\" {Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a \"fantastic guy\" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration and President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the { US } [ United States ] president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is seeking to \"reboot\" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable { Egypt } [ Egypt ] as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group. Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el Sisi ], who wants to ensure { Egypt } [ Egypt ] continues to receive { US } [ United States ] military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] as someone who has a \"deep and great understanding\" of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {. } [ Middle East ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke to President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] by phone on 10 April to offer his condolences for an attack on two churches in the country that killed dozens of people. He also { tweeted } [ Twitter ]: \"I have great confidence that { President } [ President of Egypt ] Al Sisi will handle the situation properly.\"The two again reunited during Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s first foreign visit to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], where the { US } [ United States ] president said he hoped to visit { Cairo } [ Cairo ] soon. At a summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] {, } [ Riyadh ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said \"safety seems to be very strong\" in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] {. } [ Egypt ] He added Mr Sisi had \"done a tremendous job under trying circumstance\".Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also thanked Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] for coordinating the release of { Egyptian-American } [ Egyptian Americans ] charity worker { Aya Hijazi } [ Aya Hijazi ] in April.The { White House } [ White House ] worked behind-the-scenes to secure her release after failed attempts by the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration. An image of Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], Mr { Sisi } [ Abdelaziz Sisi ] and { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted an invitation to attend this year's { Bastille Day } [ Bastille Day ] celebrations in { France } [ France ] after a somewhat rocky start with his { French } [ France ] counterpart. { French } [ France ] President { Emmanuel Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May in { Brussels } [ Brussels ] as \"not innocent\". The 39-year-old president also appeared to snub Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] while shaking hands with { Nato } [ NATO ] leaders at the { Brussels } [ Brussels ] summit. Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] has also sharply criticised Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] after he { pulled out } [ United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement ] of the { Paris climate accord } [ Paris Agreement ], mocking the \"America First\" president with a pledge to \"make the planet great again\". Meanwhile, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has been critical of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] security measures in the wake of recent terrorist attacks there. Before Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] was elected in May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in { Paris } [ Paris ] would \"have a big effect\" on the election\".Many thought Mr Trump was referring to { National Front } [ National Rally (France) ] leader { Marie Le Pen } [ Marie Le Pen ], the anti-immigrant and { anti-globalisation } [ Anti-globalization movement ] candidate who lost to Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ]. But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] in a { tweet } [ Twitter ].Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attended the 100th anniversary of { US } [ United States ] entry into { World War One } [ World War I ] on 14 July as well as a series of formal meetings between the two nations.He spoke warmly of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] revolutionary past and the beauty of { Paris } [ Paris ], and said the city {'s } [ France ] future was bright with Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] leading the country.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has yet to formally meet with or call the { Georgian } [ Georgia (country) ] Prime Minister { Giorgi Kvirikashvili } [ Giorgi Kvirikashvili ], though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] and met with Vice President { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ]. During his { White House } [ White House ] visit, the { Trump Administration } [ Presidency of Donald Trump ] thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for { Georgia } [ Georgia (country) ]'s sacrifices fighting with { NATO } [ NATO ] forces in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. Her pivotal role in global politics can be seen clearly on the { White House } [ White House ] call sheet - { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has spoken to her more than any other foreign leader and she also paid the new { president } [ President of the United States ] a visit in March. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] tone towards Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] has changed significantly since he took office though. The { German } [ Germany ] leader clearly noticed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she {'s } [ Donald Trump ] \"always said it {'s } [ Donald Trump ] much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another\". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] was unimpressed with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] command of policy details.After Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] pulled out of the Paris climate deal at the { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit, Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] said { Europe } [ Europe ] could no longer \"completely depend\" on the { US } [ United States ] and { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and should \"take their destiny into their own hands\".President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] met Prime Minister { Narendra Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] for the first time in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] { DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], in late June. The two leaders, who shared a warm embrace in front of reporters, vowed to fight { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] together, praised { US-India relations } [ India\u2013United States relations ] and issued a warning to { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. \"The relationship between { India } [ India ] and the { United States } [ United States ] has never been stronger, never been better,\" said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who describes himself and Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] as \"world leaders in social media\".Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] was also the first foreign dignitary to dine with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] Prior to the meeting {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke by phone with Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] twice. The first call happened just a couple of days after Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] The pair agreed they must stand \"shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism\" and { President } [ President of India ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] invited Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] to the { White House } [ White House ] later in 2017. The { US } [ United States ] president also rang { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of India ] { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] at the end of March to congratulate him on his party's good showing in state-level elections in { India } [ India ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has twice met { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] { Joko Widodo } [ Joko Widodo ] while abroad. Both leaders attended the { Riyadh Summit } [ May 2017 Riyadh summit ] in { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in May, but did not have their first one-on-one until the { G20 } [ July 2017 G20 Riyadh summit ] summit in July. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he expected to do a lot of trade deals and business with { Indonesia } [ Indonesia ] during the { G20 } [ G20 ] meeting. While Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration, { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and his relationship with the new president has raised eyebrows in the { US } [ United States ]. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] Hotel in { West Java } [ West Java ] and another resort in { Bali } [ Bali ] and recently told an { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] magazine that he has \"close access\" to the { US } [ United States ] president.At the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had a social media snafu that mistakenly identified { Singaporean } [ Singapore ] Prime Minister { Lee Hsien Loong } [ Lee Hsien Loong ] as Mr Widodo.The mistake sparked online backlash but was later fixed.While { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] hasn't spoken to { Iran } [ Iran ] {'s } [ Iran ] leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ] One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a { ballistic missile } [ Ballistic missile ] test, which { Tehran } [ Iran ] said had not violated a { UN } [ United Nations ] resolution on its nuclear activities.Although Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has called that UN agreement \"a terrible deal\", he is unlikely to be able to change it because it was also agreed to by the UK, { France } [ France ], { China } [ China ], { Russia } [ Russia ] and { Germany } [ Germany ]. In April, the US confirmed that { Tehran } [ Iran ] was complying with the deal, but Secretary of State { Rex Tillerson } [ Rex Tillerson ] said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had ordered a review into it nonetheless. The rhetoric of the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration has been predictably confrontational towards { Iran } [ Iran ], with Defence Secretary { James Mattis } [ James Mattis ] calling it the world's \"biggest state sponsor of terrorism\".During a trip to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], the { US } [ United States ] president blamed { Iran } [ Iran ] for instability in the region. President Trump also told { Israeli } [ Israel ] Prime Minister { Benjamin Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] in { Jerusalem } [ Jerusalem ] that { Iran } [ Iran ] \"will never have nuclear weapons\". Why has { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] been so harsh on { Iran } [ Iran ]? {Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] made defeating the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so { Iraq } [ Iraq ] is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries, including { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. The ban was eventually blocked by { US } [ United States ] judges, and when the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] Prime Minister { Haider al-Abadi } [ Haider al-Abadi ] spoke to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of { Mosul } [ Mosul ] from { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the { US } [ United States ] a few weeks later for a meeting at the { White House } [ White House ], when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters: \"Our main thrust is we have to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. We're going to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] It will happen. It's happening right now. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] congratulated his { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] counterpart, saying { Mosul } [ Mosul ] had been \"liberated from its long nightmare\" under the rule of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ].The { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on { Mexico } [ Mexico ] and the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], but they could also affect thousands of unregistered { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] immigrants in the US.Former { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] Prime Minister { Enda Kenny } [ Enda Kenny ] raised this issue with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] when he visited the { White House } [ White House ] in March, saying there were \"millions out there who want to. make { America } [ United States ] great.\"The { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] traditionally presents the new { US } [ United States ] president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr { Kenny } [ Kenny (title) ] did so while making his views on President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s immigration policies clear. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: \"We love { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] and we love the people of { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {. } [ United States ]\"The president has business interests in { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in the form of a { golf course } [ Golf course ] and resort in { Doonbeg } [ Doonbeg ], { County Clare } [ County Clare ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has yet to meet the newest { Taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] { Leo Varadkar } [ Leo Varadkar ], but the two spoke by phone for about 15 minutes following the young { prime minister } [ Prime minister ]'s confirmation. Mr { Varadkar } [ Varadkar ] was confirmed as { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {'s } [ Republic of Ireland ] youngest and first openly { gay } [ Gay ] leader in June. \"We have so many people from { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in this country - I know so many of them, I feel I know all of them,\" said Mr Trump, who invited the { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] to the { St Patrick's Day } [ Saint Patrick's Day ] celebration in March.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest ally, { Israel } [ Israel ] {. } [ United States ]He was quick to invite Prime Minister { Benjamin Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] to the { White House } [ White House ] and used their joint news conference to talk of the { US } [ United States ] standing firm with { Israel } [ Israel ], \"especially in the face of terrorism\". But he appeared to suggest the decades-old policy of a { two-state solution } [ Two-state solution ] - a { Palestinian } [ State of Palestine ] state living peacefully alongside { Israel } [ Israel ] - may not be the answer when he told journalists: \"I'm looking at two states and one state.\"He backtracked slightly a couple of days later in an interview with { Reuters } [ Reuters ], saying: \"I like this { two-state } [ Two-state solution ] solution, but I am satisfied with whatever both parties agree with.\"His administration caused another stir by saying { Israeli } [ Israel ] settlements were not \"an impediment to peace\", a change to the policy under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later told an { Israeli } [ Israel ] newspaper that settlements \"don't help the peace process\". In a speech on the eve of his { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] turned to his daughter's husband and said: \"If you can't produce peace in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] nobody can.\"During a visit to { Tel Aviv } [ Tel Aviv ] in May, he said he came to \"reaffirm the unbreakable bond\" between the { US } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] and that there was a \"rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace\" to the region.President Trump met { Italy } [ Italy ]'s { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Italy ] { Paolo Gentiloni } [ Paolo Gentiloni ] three times since taking office. He first welcomed the { Italian } [ Italy ] prime minister to the { White House } [ White House ] in April and less than a month later met him twice more before the { G-7 } [ Group of Seven ] in { Italy } [ Italy ]. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also called Mr { Gentiloni } [ Enzo Gentiloni ] in July ahead of the { Group of 20 } [ Group of 20 ] ( {G20 } [ Group of 20 ]) meeting, in which he thanked the { Italian } [ Italy ] PM for hosting the \"exception { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit in May\".Japan's Prime Minister { Shinzo Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] arrived in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ] on 9 February for a meeting with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. They held a joint press conference in which Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said the { US } [ United States ] is committed to further strengthening the \"very crucial alliance\" - but the highlight of the visit for the media was the president's uncomfortably long handshake and Mr { Abe } [ Nobuhito Abe ] {'s } [ Nobuhito Abe ] reaction to it. After talks in the capital, the pair jetted off with their wives to spend the weekend at Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] and the two men went for a round of { golf } [ Golf ]. Their weekend was interrupted by news that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] had conducted a missile test - and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was criticised after images appeared to show them discussing the incident in a public restaurant, raising security concerns. But overall, Mr { Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] will have been pleased with how the trip went and other world leaders are likely to use his visit as a template for building a relationship with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ].The pair reunited on the sidelines of the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit to discuss { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s { nuclear program } [ North Korea and weapons of mass destruction ] in July. Mr { Abe } [ Benjamin Abe ] told Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] the situation \"has become increasingly severe\".Jordan's { King Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was the first { Arab } [ Arab world ] leader to meet { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he is also the only foreign leader to have met him more than once so far. The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the { National Prayer Breakfast } [ National Prayer Breakfast ], an annual event held in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King { Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was invited back to the capital in April for an official meeting with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. { Jordan } [ Jordan ] is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised the king and his armed forces for their help. \" {Jordanian } [ Jordan ] service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. The two men also talked about the civil war in { Syria } [ Syria ] and it was in their joint press conference that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] described a chemical attack on a rebel-held town as a \"heinous action\" by the { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] regime that \"cannot be tolerated\". Two days later the US responded by launching a missile strike on a military airfield in { Syria } [ Syria ]. In early July, { Jordan } [ Jordan ] agreed to coordinate with the US and { Russia } [ Russia ] to put in place a ceasefire across south-western { Syria } [ Syria ].US relations with { Kenya } [ Kenya ] are likely to be very different under { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] to how they were under { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ], whose father was { Kenyan } [ Kenya ]. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - { Egypt } [ Egypt ], { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ] and { South Africa } [ South Africa ] - before speaking to { Kenya } [ Kenya ]'s President { Uhuru Kenyatta } [ Uhuru Kenyatta ] was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised { Kenya } [ Kenya ]'s \"significant contributions\" to the { African Union } [ African Union ] force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring { Somalia } [ Somalia ]. The { US } [ United States ] in May suspended $21m of funding to { Kenya } [ Kenya ]'s ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. { Kenya } [ Kenya ] has said it would strengthen its { accounting } [ Accounting ] {. } [ Kenya ]President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] met the emir of { Kuwait } [ Kuwait ], Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ].The pair previously spoke by { phone } [ Telephone ] at the beginning of February.Libya's leaders are yet to talk to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], but their country was one of six predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] states that he has tried - and failed - to ban people coming to the { US } [ United States ] from. The country has been beset by chaos since { Nato } [ NATO ]-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col { Muammar Gaddafi } [ Muammar Gaddafi ] in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group ( {IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years but { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is yet to articulate what his policy is on the country.No { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting \"Build the wall, build the wall!\" It was the policy that defined Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who has said repeatedly that { Mexico } [ Mexico ] will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States barrier ] in an { executive order } [ Executive order ] signed on 25 January. But just two days later, { Mexican } [ Mexico ] President { Enrique Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: \"I've said time and again: { Mexico } [ Mexico ] won't pay for any { wall } [ Trump wall ].\" Mr { Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] was due to go to the { White House } [ White House ] for a meeting, but he cancelled the trip and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said it would have been \"fruitless\" if { Mexico } [ Mexico ] didn't treat the { US } [ United States ] \"with respect\".One idea to pay for the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] that President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] floated was a tax on goods imported from { Mexico } [ Mexico ] but that appeared to be dropped after it was criticised by politicians on both sides of the border.Construction on the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] is yet to start because Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] needs { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the { border } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] have been given more power.How realistic is { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s wall? {New Zealand } [ New Zealand ]'s Prime Minister { Bill English } [ Bill English ] has spoken to { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] once over the phone so far. The call happened on 5 February. A short { White House } [ White House ] summary of the call said the two leaders had \"affirmed the close friendship\" between the countries and discussed \"peace and security\".Prime Minister { English } [ Bill English ] gave a little more detail to reporters in { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ] {. } [ Bill English ] He said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was \"warm, civil and very thoughtful\" and that they discussed topics from { immigration } [ Immigration ] bans to the { Super Bowl } [ Super Bowl ] {. } [ Super Bowl ]\"He has a more casual attitude to diplomatic relationships than is usual,\" Mr { English } [ English people ] told the { New Zealand Herald } [ The New Zealand Herald ], adding that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he is welcome at the { White House } [ White House ] \"if you're passing by\".President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has spoken to { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ]'s President { Muhammadu Buhari } [ Muhammadu Buhari ] by phone once so far, on 15 February. Judging by the { White House } [ White House ] readout, it was a fairly routine conversation. However, one line did cause some controversy: \"President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] expressed support for the sale of aircraft from the { United States } [ United States ] to support { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ]'s fight against { Boko Haram } [ Boko Haram ].The deal needs to be approved by the { US Congress } [ United States Congress ], but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important { human rights } [ Human rights ] concerns are to { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] when it comes to trade.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is a big fan of { Poland } [ Poland ] and { its people } [ Poles ] {. } [ Polish people ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke of \"the triumph of the { Polish } [ Poland ] spirit over centuries of hardship\" as an inspiration \"for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war\" during his speech in { Warsaw } [ Warsaw ] {. } [ Warsaw ]He also thanked the country for buying { Patriot } [ MIM-104 Patriot ] missile defence systems from the { US } [ United States ] in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the { Nato } [ NATO ] alliance. \" {America } [ United States ] loves { Poland } [ Poland ], and { America } [ United States ] loves the { Polish } [ Poland ] people,\" he declared.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is unlikely to be meeting or even calling { North Korean } [ North Korea ] leader { Kim Jong-un } [ Kim Jong-un ] any time soon, but the young leader has been the subject of some increasingly heated rhetoric from the { US } [ United States ] in recent months.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is angry that the { North Koreans } [ North Korea ] continue to pursue their nuclear ambitions with little consequence and he has sought to put pressure on { China } [ China ] to try to contain its neighbour.His comments follow those of { US } [ United States ] ambassador to the UN { Nikki Haley } [ Nikki Haley ], who said the { US } [ United States ] was willing to use its \"considerable military forces\" on { North Korea } [ North Korea ] \"if we must\".North Korean Vice Foreign Minister { Han Song-ryol } [ Han Song-ryol ] has previously told the { BBC } [ BBC ]: \"If the { US } [ United States ] is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike.\" { China } [ China ], meanwhile, has reiterated its call for { North Korea } [ North Korea ] to stop all missile tests and called for both sides to \"avoid taking provocative actions that pour oil on the fire\".The { US } [ United States ] and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] have flexed their military muscle, firing missiles into the { Sea of Japan } [ Sea of Japan ] and ramping up military drills. { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] said it would not negotiate its weapons programme unless the { US } [ United States ] ended its \"hostile policy\" against { North Korea } [ North Korea ].Tensions with the { US } [ United States ] have escalated since the death of a { US } [ United States ] student who had been jailed in { North Korea } [ North Korea ] for more than 15 months. { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] returned Mr { Warmbier } [ Otto Warmbier ] to the { US } [ United States ] in June on humanitarian grounds, saying he had been in a { coma } [ Coma ] for a year. The 22-year-old died less than a week later.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] first met President { Mahmoud Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] during the { Palestinian Authority } [ Palestinian National Authority ] leader's { White House } [ White House ] visit at the beginning of May. He said there was a \"very good chance\" of a { Middle East } [ Middle East ] peace deal, telling Mr { Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] during a joint news conference: \"We will get this done\".During a visit to { Bethlehem } [ Bethlehem ] to meet Mr Abbas again on 23 May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he would \"do everything\" to help { Israelis } [ Israel ] and { Palestinians } [ State of Palestine ] achieve peace. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also said that he was \"gratified\" that Mr { Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] had attended the summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] and \"committed to taking firm but necessary steps to fight terrorism and confront its hateful ideology\".President Trump met President { Juan Carlos Varela } [ Juan Carlos Varela ] of { Panama } [ Panama ] in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] focus on the { Panama Canal } [ Panama Canal ] {, } [ Panama Canal ] which was opened by the { US } [ United States ] in 1914. \"The { Panama Canal } [ Panama Canal ] is doing quite well,\" he said at the { White House } [ White House ] meeting. \"I think we did a good job building it.\"Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also praised US-Panama relations, saying \"things are going well\" and \"the relationship has been very strong\".Peruvian { President } [ President of Peru ] { Pedro Pablo Kuczynski } [ Pedro Pablo Kuczynski ] has already had a substantial amount of contact with { President } [ President of Peru ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The two men have spoken twice over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the { White House } [ White House ]. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the { Peruvian } [ Peru ] president is particularly interested in persuading the { US } [ United States ] to deport its fugitive ex-leader { Alejandro Toledo } [ Alejandro Toledo ] {. } [ Alejandro Toledo ] He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] to \"evaluate\" the situation.In May Mr Kuczynski also spoke to Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] about tackling the economic and political crisis in { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ], as well as to thank his { American } [ United States ] counterpart for providing humanitarian assistance in devastating floods in { Peru } [ Peru ].President { Rodrigo Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] had a \"very friendly conversation\" with Trump on 29 April, in which they discussed { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and \"the fact that the { Philippine } [ Philippines ] government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.\" Mr { Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] has been widely criticized for { human rights } [ Human rights ] violations in the { Philippines } [ Philippines ] {. } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] He has authorised { police } [ Police ] and { vigilantes } [ Vigilantism ] to maim and kill drug users on the streets of { Manila } [ Manila ]. His relationship with the { US } [ United States ] had been rocky in the past, in part because former { President } [ President of the United States ] { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] criticized the { extrajudicial executions } [ Extrajudicial killing ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] however, has had a warmer relationship with his { Philippine } [ Philippines ] counterpart so far. He invited Mr { Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] to the { White House } [ White House ] and has plans to visit the { Philippines } [ Philippines ] in November for the { East Asia Summit } [ East Asia Summit ] and the US-ASEAN Summit.Mr { Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] responded by saying he may be too \"tied up\" to accept the { White House } [ White House ] visit.Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is one of many foreign leaders to have held one phone conversation with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The call with the { Qatari } [ Qatar ] emir came in early February amid an attempted travel ban by Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] that affected several { Middle Eastern } [ Middle East ] countries, but not { Qatar } [ Qatar ] itself. The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group, with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] countries cut travel and embassy links with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical { Islamism } [ Islamism ] {. } [ Islamism ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took initial credit for applying pressure on { Qatar } [ Qatar ] in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark \"the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism\". In early June, he again accused { Qatar } [ Qatar ] of funding terrorism, tweeting:\"During my recent trip to the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to { Qatar } [ Qatar ] \u2013 look!\"But { Washington } [ United States ] would stand to benefit most from a resolution with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] as the US ally is home to the largest { American } [ United States ] military facility in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ].No { US } [ United States ] relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] {. } [ Russia ]US intelligence agencies accused { Russia } [ Russia ] of being behind the hacking of the { Democratic Party } [ Democratic Party (United States) ]'s email server and then a dossier emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s ties to Russia } [ Russia\u2013United States relations ]. The president was then forced to fire aide { Mike Flynn } [ Mike Flynn ] after evidence emerged that he spoke to { Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] ambassador to the US about lifting { sanctions } [ International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis ] on the country without being authorised to do so.The { FBI } [ Federal Bureau of Investigation ] has confirmed that it has been investigating alleged { Russian } [ Russia ] interference in the election since July last year, including examining possible links between Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s campaign } [ Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ] and { Moscow } [ Russia ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has dismissed the entire { Russia } [ Russia ] scandal as \"fake news\" and accused { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Mr Trump told the { Christian Broadcasting Network } [ Christian Broadcasting Network ] he gets along \"very well\" with { Russian } [ Russia ] President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ], citing the recent ceasefire in south-western { Syria } [ Syria ] as an example of his co-operation with the { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ]. He also said he directly asked Mr { Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] twice if he meddled in the { US election } [ 2016 United States presidential election ] - to which the { Russian } [ Russia ] president said he did not - at the pair's much-anticipated meeting at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].But he has { tweeted } [ Twitter ] about { Russia } [ Russia ] dozens of times - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.The latest Trump associate to become entangled in the { Russia } [ Russia ] controversy is his son, { Donald Trump Jr } [ Donald Trump Jr. ], who confirmed he met { Russian } [ Russia ] lawyer { Natalia Veselnitskaya } [ Natalia Veselnitskaya ] on June 9 2016 after being told that she had damaging material on { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Russia: The scandal { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] can't shake {Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] has had a close relationship with the { US } [ United States ] for decades and that appears to be continuing under President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ].He also attended the Arab Islamic American Summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ], which focused on combating { Islamist } [ Islam ] militants and the growing regional influence of { Iran } [ Iran ]. Relations had soured somewhat under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] after his administration's nuclear deal with { Iran } [ Iran ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in a diplomatic standoff with { Qatar } [ Qatar ]. Saudi Arabia and other { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] nations cut off ties with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over allegations that it funds terror groups.But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], quoted by { Reuters } [ Reuters ], told { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] on the matter, \"it's important that the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] be united for peace and security in the region\".While { President } [ President of the United States ] Trump has not spoken to { Somali } [ Somalia ] { President } [ President of the United States ] { Hassan Sheikh Mohamud } [ Hassan Sheikh Mohamud ], he has tried to ban { Somalis } [ Somalia ] from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from { Iran } [ Iran ], { Libya } [ Libya ], { Somalia } [ Somalia ], { Sudan } [ Sudan ], { Syria } [ Syria ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ] for 90 days. { He } [ George W. Bush ] has described the affected nations as \"terror-prone countries\".In May, a member of the { US } [ United States ] military was killed in { Somalia } [ Somalia ], the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous { Black Hawk Down } [ Black Hawk Down ( incident) ] incident. The { US } [ United States ] announced in April that it is sending dozens of troops to { Somalia } [ Somalia ] to train forces fighting { Islamist } [ Islam ] group { al-Shabab } [ Al-Shabab (militant group) ].It is the first time regular { US } [ United States ] troops have been deployed in { Somalia } [ Somalia ] since 1994, although some { counter-terrorism } [ Counter-terrorism ] advisers are already there. In 1993, 18 { US } [ United States ] { special forces } [ Special forces ] personnel were killed in the incident dramatised in the { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ] film { Black Hawk Down } [ Black Hawk Down (film) ].Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about { South Africa } [ South Africa ], tweeting that the country was a \"mess\". Now that he's { president } [ President of South Africa ], however, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is taking a slightly more diplomatic approach and told { President } [ President of South Africa ] { Jacob Zuma } [ Jacob Zuma ] that he hopes to \"expand cooperation and trade\" between the two countries. According to the President { Zuma } [ Jacob Zuma ]'s government, there are 600 { US } [ United States ] companies operating in { South Africa } [ South Africa ] {. } [ United States ]Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has long considered renegotiating the { free trade } [ Free trade ] agreement the { US } [ United States ] struck with { South Korea } [ South Korea ] in 2012. He has referred to the agreement as \"a horrible deal\" that has \"destroyed\" the { US } [ United States ]. { South Korea } [ South Korea ] is a major { US } [ United States ] trade partner, with the { US } [ United States ] exchanging about $144.  Before entering the { White House } [ White House ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Donald said of the deal during an interview with { NBC } [ NBC ] in January: \"We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this.\"\"Nothing\" is a little unfair seeing as the { South Koreans } [ South Korea ] pay around $800 million a year to fund the { US } [ United States ] deployment, but his sentiment was clear: Why do we bother?The answer seemed clear after his repeated threats of military action to the { North Korea } [ North Korea ] for conducting further missile tests this year.  In calls with { South Korea } [ South Korea ]'s acting President { Hwang Kyo-ahn } [ Hwang Kyo-ahn ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has \"reiterated our ironclad commitment\" to defend its ally and strengthen \"joint defence capabilities\". He also dispatched Vice President { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ] to { Seoul } [ Seoul ] to show support for { South Korea } [ South Korea ]. During the visit {, } [ Vice President of the United States ] Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] told his hosts: \"We are with you 100 {%. } [ Hypocorism ]\"\" {North Korea } [ North Korea ] would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the { United States } [ United States ] in this region,\" Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] added.Prime Minister { Mariano Rajoy } [ Mariano Rajoy ] has spoken to { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] once on the phone so far, in what appears to have been a short call on 7 February. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] once again \"emphasised the importance of all { Nato } [ NATO ] allies sharing the burden of defence spending\".President Trump met { Singapore } [ Singapore ]'s Prime Minister, { Lee Hsien Loong } [ Lee Hsien Loong ], at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ], { Germany } [ Germany ] in July. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said of { Singapore } [ Singapore ]: \"We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some { Singapore } [ Singapore ] officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic { protectionism } [ Protectionism ] in { America } [ United States ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr Lee to visit the { White House } [ White House ] in an April phone call \"to further strengthen ties\", the { White House } [ White House ] said.Sudan is another of the predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries that { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has included on his { travel ban list } [ Donald Trump travel ban ]. The { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] It means people without \"close\" family or business relationships in the { US } [ United States ] could be denied { visas } [ Travel visa ] and barred entry. More recently, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against { Sudan } [ Sudan ] so he could have more time to \"establish that the government of { Sudan } [ Sudan ] has demonstrated sufficient positive action\" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The { US } [ United States ] has issued sanctions against { Sudan } [ Sudan ] since the 1990s, when it was accused of { state-sponsored terrorism } [ State-sponsored terrorism ] {. } [ State-sponsored terrorism ]President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] caused a bit of a stir about { Sweden } [ Sweden ] during one of his regular attacks on the { media } [ News media ] at a rally in February. \"Look at what's happening last night in { Sweden } [ Sweden ] {. } [ Sweden ] { Sweden } [ Sweden ], who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers of { migrants } [ Immigration ]. { They } [ American Airlines ]'re having problems like { they } [ American Airlines ] never thought possible,\" the new { US } [ United States ] president told the crowd in { Florida } [ Florida ] {. } [ United States ]The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was referring to - not least lots of baffled { Swedes } [ Sweden ]. It later emerged that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had been referring to a report on { Fox News } [ Fox News ] about gun violence and rape in { Sweden } [ Sweden ] since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But { police officers } [ Police officer ] interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or { rape } [ Rape ]. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister { Stefan Lofven } [ Stefan Lofven ] during this saga, he did phone the { Swedish } [ Sweden ] leader in April to express condolences over an attack in { Stockholm } [ Stockholm ] {. } [ Stockholm ]Syria is another country that { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the { US } [ United States ] president. When his { predecessor } [ Barack Obama ] was considering military action in { Syria } [ Syria ] back in 2013, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was a vocal critic against intervention.\"Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack { Syria } [ Syria ] - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the { US } [ United States ] gets nothing,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] { tweeted } [ Twitter ] in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by { Syrian } [ Syria ] forces that he was taking military action. \"Using a deadly nerve agent, { Syrian } [ Syria ] President { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. \"No child of { God } [ God ] should ever suffer such horror.\"Two { US Navy } [ United States Navy ] ships fired 59 { Tomahawk } [ Tomahawk (missile) ] cruise missiles at a { Syrian } [ Syria ] air base from their positions in the { Mediterranean } [ Mediterranean Sea ]. It was the first direct { US } [ United States ] military action against the { Syrian } [ Syria ] president's forces.More recently, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has touted a ceasefire in the south-western part of { Syria } [ Syria ] brokered by the { US } [ United States ] and { Russia } [ Russia ].The { ceasefire } [ Ceasefire ] is in force along a line agreed by { Syrian } [ Syria ] government forces, which are supported by { Russia } [ Russia ], and the US-backed rebels.President { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] called { Thailand } [ Thailand ]'s Prime Minister { Prayut Chan-ocha } [ Prayut Chan-ocha ], who took control of the country in a { 2014 coup } [ 2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat ], to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the { US } [ United States ] had been somewhat strained in the past because of { human rights } [ Human rights ] complaints.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] seems to have warmer feelings toward { Thailand } [ Thailand ]'s { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] {. } [ Prime minister ] According to a { White House } [ White House ] statement {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] the two leaders discussed \"a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries.\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr { Chan-ocha } [ Chan-ocha ] to visit the { White House } [ White House ] for the first time since Mr { Chan-ocha } [ Chan-ocha ] assumed power.Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, { Trinidad and Tobago } [ Trinidad and Tobago ] Prime Minister { Keith Rowley } [ Keith Rowley ] spoke to { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] on the phone in February to discuss \"shared priorities\". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some { US } [ United States ] officials worried that the small { Caribbean } [ Caribbean ] island could become a \"breeding ground for extremists\", according to the { New York Times } [ The New York Times ]. The island's former US ambassador { John Estrada } [ John Estrada ] told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ].When { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] announced a ban on people entering the { US } [ United States ] from several predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries, some analysts were surprised not to see { Tunisia } [ Tunisia ] on the list. The { Arab Spring } [ Arab Spring ] began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with { Tunisian } [ Tunisia ] President { Beji Caid Essebsi } [ Beji Caid Essebsi ] is important in the fight against { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and he praised the country's \"stability and security\" in a phone call with its leader in February.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s relationship with Turkey's President { Recep Tayyip Erdogan } [ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ] is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a { Trump Tower } [ Trump Tower (Istanbul) ] complex in { Istanbul } [ Istanbul ] in 2012. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was at the launch of the property, as was Mr { Erdogan } [ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ] (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr { Erdogan } [ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ]'s { White House } [ White House ] visit in May, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. Relations have also been strained with the { Nato } [ NATO ] ally by Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s decision to arm the { Syrian Kurds } [ Syrian Kurdistan ] in the battle against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. Turkey views the { YPG } [ Popular Protection Units ] (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the { PKK } [ Kurdistan Workers' Party ], a { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] separatist group.Donald Trump said he had \"very, very good discussions\" with { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] {'s } [ Ukraine ] President { Petro Poroshenko } [ Petro Poroshenko ] during the foreign leader {'s } [ Ukraine ] { White House } [ White House ] visit in late June.Later in July, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] called on { Russia } [ Russia ] to stop \"destabilising\" { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and \"join the community of responsible nations\". The { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ] brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] of having been weak on { Russia } [ Russia ] and allowing them to \"pick off\" the { Crimean } [ Crimea ] peninsula from { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ]. The { US } [ United States ] president's calls for better ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] have worried { Ukrainian } [ Ukraine ] authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against { Russia } [ Russia ] for its role in the conflicts in { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] would remain even after his meeting with President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].The Crown Prince Sheikh { Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan } [ Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ] spoke with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new { US } [ United States ] president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the { White House } [ White House ], the { crown prince } [ Crown prince ] backed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s idea of safe zones for refugees in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ]. The { UAE } [ United Arab Emirates ] was not one of the countries that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] tried to ban people travelling to the { US } [ United States ] from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few { Middle East } [ Middle East ] officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] proposed ban as a \"sovereign decision\" and said some of the countries on the list \"face structural problems\" that need to be dealt with. The { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of Pakistan ] got some signs that { President } [ President of Pakistan ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] would be open to negotiating a trade deal with the UK after it leaves the { European Union } [ European Union ], though there was no firm guarantee.  \"Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in { commerce } [ Commerce ] {, } [ Commerce ] business { and } [ Business ] foreign affairs,\" he said at their joint press conference {. } [ Commerce ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted the invitation Mrs { May } [ May government ] extended from the { Queen } [ Elizabeth II ] for a { state visit } [ State visit ], but the prospect stirred controversy back in the UK. Nearly two million people signed one of a number of { petitions } [ Petition ] calling to withdraw Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] invite {. } [ Donald Trump ] The { US } [ United States ] president reportedly changed his mind and is now expected to travel to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] in 2018, the { BBC } [ BBC ] understands.He came under criticism for attacking { London } [ London ] Mayor { Sadiq Khan } [ Sadiq Khan ] over his response to recent terror attacks.Human rights have not been at the top of { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s agenda so far, but his one public mention of { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] was to call for the release of a political prisoner in the { South American } [ South America ] state. \" {Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,\" he tweeted in mid-February. { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the { socialist } [ Socialism ] President { Nicolas Maduro } [ Nicolas Maduro ] and those who blame him. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including { Brazil } [ Brazil ] and { Colombia } [ Colombia ], but he has not spoken directly to President { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ]. Mr { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ], however, has sent a word of warning to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], saying in a televised speech: \"Don't repeat the errors of { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] and { Bush } [ George H. W.

The mission didn't go to plan. The { US Navy } [ United States Navy ] { Seals } [ United States Navy Seals ] came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group ( {AQAP } [ Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ]) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of { civilians } [ Civilian ] were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. In an interview with { Fox News } [ Fox News ], { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William \"Ryan\" Owens on military leaders. \"This was a mission that was started before I got here,\" { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. \"They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. And they lost { Ryan } [ Ryanathons ] {. } [ Ryanathons ]\"A { New York Times } [ The New York Times ] article claimed the { Navy Seals } [ United States Navy Seals ] found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting { AQAP } [ American AQAP ] communications but they \"pressed on toward their target\" nonetheless.

Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has described the six { Muslim-majority } [ Muslim world ] nations included in the ban as \"terror-prone countries\".President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest ally, { Israel } [ Israel ] {. } [ United States ]He was quick to invite Prime Minister { Benjamin Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] to the { White House } [ White House ] and used their joint news conference to talk of the { US } [ United States ] standing firm with { Israel } [ Israel ], \"especially in the face of terrorism\". But he appeared to suggest the decades-old policy of a { two-state solution } [ Two-state solution ] - a { Palestinian } [ State of Palestine ] state living peacefully alongside { Israel } [ Israel ] - may not be the answer when he told journalists: \"I'm looking at two states and one state.\"He backtracked slightly a couple of days later in an interview with { Reuters } [ Reuters ], saying: \"I like this { two-state } [ Two-state solution ] solution, but I am satisfied with whatever both parties agree with.\"His administration caused another stir by saying { Israeli } [ Israel ] settlements were not \"an impediment to peace\", a change to the policy under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later told an { Israeli } [ Israel ] newspaper that settlements \"don't help the peace process\". In a speech on the eve of his { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] turned to his daughter's husband and said: \"If you can't produce peace in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] nobody can.\"During a visit to { Tel Aviv } [ Tel Aviv ] in May, he said he came to \"reaffirm the unbreakable bond\" between the { US } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] and that there was a \"rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace\" to the region.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] first met President { Mahmoud Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] during the { Palestinian Authority } [ Palestinian National Authority ] leader's { White House } [ White House ] visit at the beginning of May. He said there was a \"very good chance\" of a { Middle East } [ Middle East ] peace deal, telling Mr { Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] during a joint news conference: \"We will get this done\".During a visit to { Bethlehem } [ Bethlehem ] to meet Mr Abbas again on 23 May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he would \"do everything\" to help { Israelis } [ Israel ] and { Palestinians } [ State of Palestine ] achieve peace. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also said that he was \"gratified\" that Mr { Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] had attended the summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] and \"committed to taking firm but necessary steps to fight terrorism and confront its hateful ideology\".President Trump met { Italy } [ Italy ]'s { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Italy ] { Paolo Gentiloni } [ Paolo Gentiloni ] three times since taking office. He first welcomed the { Italian } [ Italy ] prime minister to the { White House } [ White House ] in April and less than a month later met him twice more before the { G-7 } [ Group of Seven ] in { Italy } [ Italy ]. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also called Mr { Gentiloni } [ Enzo Gentiloni ] in July ahead of the { Group of 20 } [ Group of 20 ] ( {G20 } [ Group of 20 ]) meeting, in which he thanked the { Italian } [ Italy ] PM for hosting the \"exception { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit in May\".Japan's Prime Minister { Shinzo Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] arrived in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ] on 9 February for a meeting with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. They held a joint press conference in which Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said the { US } [ United States ] is committed to further strengthening the \"very crucial alliance\" - but the highlight of the visit for the media was the president's uncomfortably long handshake and Mr { Abe } [ Nobuhito Abe ] {'s } [ Nobuhito Abe ] reaction to it. After talks in the capital, the pair jetted off with their wives to spend the weekend at Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] and the two men went for a round of { golf } [ Golf ]. Their weekend was interrupted by news that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] had conducted a missile test - and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was criticised after images appeared to show them discussing the incident in a public restaurant, raising security concerns. But overall, Mr { Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] will have been pleased with how the trip went and other world leaders are likely to use his visit as a template for building a relationship with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ].The pair reunited on the sidelines of the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit to discuss { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s { nuclear program } [ North Korea and weapons of mass destruction ] in July. Mr { Abe } [ Benjamin Abe ] told Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] the situation \"has become increasingly severe\".No { US } [ United States ] relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] {. } [ Russia ]US intelligence agencies accused { Russia } [ Russia ] of being behind the hacking of the { Democratic Party } [ Democratic Party (United States) ]'s email server and then a dossier emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s ties to Russia } [ Russia\u2013United States relations ]. The president was then forced to fire aide { Mike Flynn } [ Mike Flynn ] after evidence emerged that he spoke to { Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] ambassador to the US about lifting { sanctions } [ International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis ] on the country without being authorised to do so.The { FBI } [ Federal Bureau of Investigation ] has confirmed that it has been investigating alleged { Russian } [ Russia ] interference in the election since July last year, including examining possible links between Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s campaign } [ Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ] and { Moscow } [ Russia ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has dismissed the entire { Russia } [ Russia ] scandal as \"fake news\" and accused { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Mr Trump told the { Christian Broadcasting Network } [ Christian Broadcasting Network ] he gets along \"very well\" with { Russian } [ Russia ] President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ], citing the recent ceasefire in south-western { Syria } [ Syria ] as an example of his co-operation with the { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ]. He also said he directly asked Mr { Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] twice if he meddled in the { US election } [ 2016 United States presidential election ] - to which the { Russian } [ Russia ] president said he did not - at the pair's much-anticipated meeting at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].But he has { tweeted } [ Twitter ] about { Russia } [ Russia ] dozens of times - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.The latest Trump associate to become entangled in the { Russia } [ Russia ] controversy is his son, { Donald Trump Jr } [ Donald Trump Jr. ], who confirmed he met { Russian } [ Russia ] lawyer { Natalia Veselnitskaya } [ Natalia Veselnitskaya ] on June 9 2016 after being told that she had damaging material on { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Russia: The scandal { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] can't shakeUK Prime Minister { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] was the first foreign leader to be welcomed to the { White House } [ White House ] by President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of Pakistan ] got some signs that { President } [ President of Pakistan ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] would be open to negotiating a trade deal with the UK after it leaves the { European Union } [ European Union ], though there was no firm guarantee.  \"Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in { commerce } [ Commerce ] {, } [ Commerce ] business { and } [ Business ] foreign affairs,\" he said at their joint press conference {. } [ Commerce ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted the invitation Mrs { May } [ May government ] extended from the { Queen } [ Elizabeth II ] for a { state visit } [ State visit ], but the prospect stirred controversy back in the UK.

The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the { National Prayer Breakfast } [ National Prayer Breakfast ], an annual event held in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King { Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was invited back to the capital in April for an official meeting with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. { Jordan } [ Jordan ] is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised the king and his armed forces for their help. \" {Jordanian } [ Jordan ] service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. The two men also talked about the civil war in { Syria } [ Syria ] and it was in their joint press conference that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] described a chemical attack on a rebel-held town as a \"heinous action\" by the { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] regime that \"cannot be tolerated\". Two days later the US responded by launching a missile strike on a military airfield in { Syria } [ Syria ]. In early July, { Jordan } [ Jordan ] agreed to coordinate with the US and { Russia } [ Russia ] to put in place a ceasefire across south-western { Syria } [ Syria ].He also attended the Arab Islamic American Summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ], which focused on combating { Islamist } [ Islam ] militants and the growing regional influence of { Iran } [ Iran ]. Relations had soured somewhat under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] after his administration's nuclear deal with { Iran } [ Iran ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in a diplomatic standoff with { Qatar } [ Qatar ]. Saudi Arabia and other { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] nations cut off ties with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over allegations that it funds terror groups.But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], quoted by { Reuters } [ Reuters ], told { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] on the matter, \"it's important that the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] be united for peace and security in the region\".Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] mentioned { China } [ China ] so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a { meme } [ Meme ]. He repeatedly called the { Communist } [ Communism ] state a \"currency manipulator\" and even accused them of \"raping\" the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] They want to overtake us and if we don't get smart and tough soon, they will.\"But just a few months into his presidency, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] welcomed { Chinese } [ China ] President { Xi Jinping } [ Xi Jinping ] to his { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] with open arms and described the pair's relationship as \"outstanding\". He decided against taking { China } [ China ]'s leader for a round of { golf } [ Golf ] though - Mr Xi has shut down several { golf } [ Golf ] courses since coming into power and banned the { Communist Party } [ Communist Party of China ]'s 88 million members from teeing off. The { White House } [ White House ] released few details about the pair's discussions but the meeting appeared to go well. \"I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\" an optimistic Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters. A few days later he tweeted: \"Why would I call { China } [ China ] a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the { North Korean } [ North Korea ] problem? We will see what happens!\"  But Mr Trump's positive outlook on { China } [ China ] again hardened in June, when he expressed frustration that { China } [ China ] was not doing more to curb { North } [ North Korea ] nuclear ambitions.China, which is { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s main economic ally, and { Russia } [ Russia ] have urged { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] to halt its ballistic missile programme in exchange while also calling for the US and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] to suspend their large-scale military exercises in the region.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to empathise with { China } [ China ], tweeting on 20 June: \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President { Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] & { China } [ China ] to help with { North Korea } [ North Korea ], it has not worked out. At least I know { China } [ China ] tried!\" But the { White House } [ White House ] later angered { Beijing } [ China ] by imposing sanctions on { Chinese } [ China ] businesses that it claimed did business with { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and agreed to new arms sales to { Taiwan } [ Taiwan ].In early July, he expressed impatience with { China } [ China ] after { North Korea } [ North Korea ] launched an { intercontinental ballistic missile } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] {. } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] He tweeted: \"Perhaps { China } [ China ] will put a heavy move on { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and end this nonsense once and for all!\"But when the two world leaders met again at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Germany } [ Germany ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] struck a more conciliatory tone. { \"It's an honour to have you as a friend } [ Friendship ] {,\" he } [ George Harrison ] told { Mr Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] {. } [ George Harrison ] \"As far as { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is concerned, we will have, eventually, success.

But there will be success in the end one way or the other.Danish Prime Minister { Lars Lokke Rasmussen } [ Lars Lokke Rasmussen ] is one of roughly a dozen world leaders to have met { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. Their talks at the end of March focused on the future of the { Nato } [ NATO ] alliance and President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] \"urged\" the { Danish } [ Denmark ] leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.\"President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] met Prime Minister { Narendra Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] for the first time in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] { DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], in late June. The two leaders, who shared a warm embrace in front of reporters, vowed to fight { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] together, praised { US-India relations } [ India\u2013United States relations ] and issued a warning to { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. \"The relationship between { India } [ India ] and the { United States } [ United States ] has never been stronger, never been better,\" said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who describes himself and Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] as \"world leaders in social media\".Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] was also the first foreign dignitary to dine with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] Prior to the meeting {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke by phone with Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] twice. The first call happened just a couple of days after Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] The pair agreed they must stand \"shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism\" and { President } [ President of India ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] invited Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] to the { White House } [ White House ] later in 2017. The { US } [ United States ] president also rang { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of India ] { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] at the end of March to congratulate him on his party's good showing in state-level elections in { India } [ India ].Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] made defeating the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so { Iraq } [ Iraq ] is central to his { foreign policy } [ Foreign policy ] objectives. However, his relationship with { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries, including { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. The ban was eventually blocked by { US } [ United States ] judges, and when the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] Prime Minister { Haider al-Abadi } [ Haider al-Abadi ] spoke to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of { Mosul } [ Mosul ] from { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the { US } [ United States ] a few weeks later for a meeting at the { White House } [ White House ], when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters: \"Our main thrust is we have to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. We're going to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] It will happen. It's happening right now. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] congratulated his { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] counterpart, saying { Mosul } [ Mosul ] had been \"liberated from its long nightmare\" under the rule of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ].The { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on { Mexico } [ Mexico ] and the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], but they could also affect thousands of unregistered { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] immigrants in the US.Former { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] Prime Minister { Enda Kenny } [ Enda Kenny ] raised this issue with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] when he visited the { White House } [ White House ] in March, saying there were \"millions out there who want to. make { America } [ United States ] great.\"The { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] traditionally presents the new { US } [ United States ] president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr { Kenny } [ Kenny (title) ] did so while making his views on President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s immigration policies clear. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: \"We love { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] and we love the people of { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {. } [ United States ]\"The president has business interests in { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in the form of a { golf course } [ Golf course ] and resort in { Doonbeg } [ Doonbeg ], { County Clare } [ County Clare ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has yet to meet the newest { Taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] { Leo Varadkar } [ Leo Varadkar ], but the two spoke by phone for about 15 minutes following the young { prime minister } [ Prime minister ]'s confirmation. Mr { Varadkar } [ Varadkar ] was confirmed as { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {'s } [ Republic of Ireland ] youngest and first openly { gay } [ Gay ] leader in June. \"We have so many people from { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in this country - I know so many of them, I feel I know all of them,\" said Mr Trump, who invited the { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] to the { St Patrick's Day } [ Saint Patrick's Day ] celebration in March. Her pivotal role in global politics can be seen clearly on the { White House } [ White House ] call sheet - { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has spoken to her more than any other foreign leader and she also paid the new { president } [ President of the United States ] a visit in March. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] tone towards Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] has changed significantly since he took office though. The { German } [ Germany ] leader clearly noticed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she {'s } [ Donald Trump ] \"always said it {'s } [ Donald Trump ] much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another\". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] was unimpressed with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] command of policy details.After Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] pulled out of the Paris climate deal at the { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit, Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] said { Europe } [ Europe ] could no longer \"completely depend\" on the { US } [ United States ] and { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and should \"take their destiny into their own hands\".President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted an invitation to attend this year's { Bastille Day } [ Bastille Day ] celebrations in { France } [ France ] after a somewhat rocky start with his { French } [ France ] counterpart. { French } [ France ] President { Emmanuel Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May in { Brussels } [ Brussels ] as \"not innocent\". The 39-year-old president also appeared to snub Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] while shaking hands with { Nato } [ NATO ] leaders at the { Brussels } [ Brussels ] summit. Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] has also sharply criticised Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] after he { pulled out } [ United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement ] of the { Paris climate accord } [ Paris Agreement ], mocking the \"America First\" president with a pledge to \"make the planet great again\". Meanwhile, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has been critical of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] security measures in the wake of recent terrorist attacks there. Before Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] was elected in May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in { Paris } [ Paris ] would \"have a big effect\" on the election\".Many thought Mr Trump was referring to { National Front } [ National Rally (France) ] leader { Marie Le Pen } [ Marie Le Pen ], the anti-immigrant and { anti-globalisation } [ Anti-globalization movement ] candidate who lost to Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ]. But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] in a { tweet } [ Twitter ].Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attended the 100th anniversary of { US } [ United States ] entry into { World War One } [ World War I ] on 14 July as well as a series of formal meetings between the two nations.He spoke warmly of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] revolutionary past and the beauty of { Paris } [ Paris ], and said the city {'s } [ France ] future was bright with Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] leading the country.Australia has been one of { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the { US } [ United States ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] entered the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ White House ] Mr Trump was said to have had a \"contentious\" phone call with Prime Minister { Malcolm Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into { Australia } [ Australia ]. A { Washington Post } [ The Washington Post ] report said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the { refugee } [ Refugee ] agreement as \"the worst deal ever\". President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who later publicly criticised the deal as \"dumb\", insisted the phone call had been \"civil\" while Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] said it was a \"very frank and forthright\" conversation.The deal for the refugees, who are said to be mostly from { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], appears to be going ahead with US { Homeland Security } [ United States Department of Homeland Security ] and { State Department } [ United States Department of State ] officials currently examining their cases.Last month footage (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-40284188) leaked to the media showing Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] poking fun at his { US } [ United States ] counterpart at a dinner for media.  Both { US } [ United States ] and { Australia } [ Australia ] dismissed the incident as harmless fun.Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a \"fantastic guy\" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration and President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the { US } [ United States ] president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is seeking to \"reboot\" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable { Egypt } [ Egypt ] as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group. Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el Sisi ], who wants to ensure { Egypt } [ Egypt ] continues to receive { US } [ United States ] military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] as someone who has a \"deep and great understanding\" of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {. } [ Middle East ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke to President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] by phone on 10 April to offer his condolences for an attack on two churches in the country that killed dozens of people. He also { tweeted } [ Twitter ]: \"I have great confidence that { President } [ President of Egypt ] Al Sisi will handle the situation properly.\"The two again reunited during Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s first foreign visit to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], where the { US } [ United States ] president said he hoped to visit { Cairo } [ Cairo ] soon. At a summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] {, } [ Riyadh ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said \"safety seems to be very strong\" in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] {. } [ Egypt ] He added Mr Sisi had \"done a tremendous job under trying circumstance\".Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also thanked Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] for coordinating the release of { Egyptian-American } [ Egyptian Americans ] charity worker { Aya Hijazi } [ Aya Hijazi ] in April.The { White House } [ White House ] worked behind-the-scenes to secure her release after failed attempts by the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration. An image of Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], Mr { Sisi } [ Abdelaziz Sisi ] and { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz.No { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting \"Build the wall, build the wall!\" It was the policy that defined Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who has said repeatedly that { Mexico } [ Mexico ] will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States barrier ] in an { executive order } [ Executive order ] signed on 25 January. But just two days later, { Mexican } [ Mexico ] President { Enrique Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: \"I've said time and again: { Mexico } [ Mexico ] won't pay for any { wall } [ Trump wall ].\" Mr { Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] was due to go to the { White House } [ White House ] for a meeting, but he cancelled the trip and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said it would have been \"fruitless\" if { Mexico } [ Mexico ] didn't treat the { US } [ United States ] \"with respect\".One idea to pay for the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] that President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] floated was a tax on goods imported from { Mexico } [ Mexico ] but that appeared to be dropped after it was criticised by politicians on both sides of the border.Construction on the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] is yet to start because Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] needs { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the { border } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] have been given more power.How realistic is { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s wall? {Argentina } [ Argentina ]'s President { Mauricio Macri } [ Mauricio Macri ] is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s { New York } [ New York City ].That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr { Macri } [ Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Macri ] called the { US } [ United States ] { president-elect } [ President-elect of the United States ] last November to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in { Argentina } [ Argentina ], Mr Trump asked the { Argentine } [ Argentina ] for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in { Buenos Aires } [ Buenos Aires ] - a claim both men denied. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr { Macri } [ Rodrigo Macri ] to the { White House } [ White House ], and he is the last leader to meet him in person during his { first 100 days } [ First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency ].Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is a big fan of { Poland } [ Poland ] and { its people } [ Poles ] {. } [ Polish people ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke of \"the triumph of the { Polish } [ Poland ] spirit over centuries of hardship\" as an inspiration \"for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war\" during his speech in { Warsaw } [ Warsaw ] {. } [ Warsaw ]He also thanked the country for buying { Patriot } [ MIM-104 Patriot ] missile defence systems from the { US } [ United States ] in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the { Nato } [ NATO ] alliance. \" {America } [ United States ] loves { Poland } [ Poland ], and { America } [ United States ] loves the { Polish } [ Poland ] people,\" he declared.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has twice met { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] { Joko Widodo } [ Joko Widodo ] while abroad. Both leaders attended the { Riyadh Summit } [ May 2017 Riyadh summit ] in { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in May, but did not have their first one-on-one until the { G20 } [ July 2017 G20 Riyadh summit ] summit in July. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he expected to do a lot of trade deals and business with { Indonesia } [ Indonesia ] during the { G20 } [ G20 ] meeting. While Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration, { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and his relationship with the new president has raised eyebrows in the { US } [ United States ]. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] Hotel in { West Java } [ West Java ] and another resort in { Bali } [ Bali ] and recently told an { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] magazine that he has \"close access\" to the { US } [ United States ] president.At the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had a social media snafu that mistakenly identified { Singaporean } [ Singapore ] Prime Minister { Lee Hsien Loong } [ Lee Hsien Loong ] as Mr Widodo.The mistake sparked online backlash but was later fixed.President Trump met President { Juan Carlos Varela } [ Juan Carlos Varela ] of { Panama } [ Panama ] in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] focus on the { Panama Canal } [ Panama Canal ] {, } [ Panama Canal ] which was opened by the { US } [ United States ] in 1914. \"The { Panama Canal } [ Panama Canal ] is doing quite well,\" he said at the { White House } [ White House ] meeting. \"I think we did a good job building it.\"Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also praised US-Panama relations, saying \"things are going well\" and \"the relationship has been very strong\".Peruvian { President } [ President of Peru ] { Pedro Pablo Kuczynski } [ Pedro Pablo Kuczynski ] has already had a substantial amount of contact with { President } [ President of Peru ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The two men have spoken twice over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the { White House } [ White House ]. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the { Peruvian } [ Peru ] president is particularly interested in persuading the { US } [ United States ] to deport its fugitive ex-leader { Alejandro Toledo } [ Alejandro Toledo ] {. } [ Alejandro Toledo ] He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] to \"evaluate\" the situation.In May Mr Kuczynski also spoke to Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] about tackling the economic and political crisis in { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ], as well as to thank his { American } [ United States ] counterpart for providing humanitarian assistance in devastating floods in { Peru } [ Peru ].Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is one of many foreign leaders to have held one phone conversation with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The call with the { Qatari } [ Qatar ] emir came in early February amid an attempted travel ban by Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] that affected several { Middle Eastern } [ Middle East ] countries, but not { Qatar } [ Qatar ] itself. The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group, with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] countries cut travel and embassy links with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical { Islamism } [ Islamism ] {. } [ Islamism ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took initial credit for applying pressure on { Qatar } [ Qatar ] in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark \"the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism\". In early June, he again accused { Qatar } [ Qatar ] of funding terrorism, tweeting:\"During my recent trip to the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to { Qatar } [ Qatar ] \u2013 look!\"But { Washington } [ United States ] would stand to benefit most from a resolution with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] as the US ally is home to the largest { American } [ United States ] military facility in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ].Colombian President { Juan Manuel Santos } [ Juan Manuel Santos ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] in May and had previously spoken to his { US } [ United States ] counterpart twice by phone since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took office.The first call came in mid-February, with the pair discussing the { Colombian } [ Colombia ] government's { peace process } [ Colombian peace process ] with the { Farc } [ Farc ] rebel group. President { Santos } [ Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo ] was no doubt eager for signs that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] will back a promise by his predecessor to ask the { US Congress } [ United States Congress ] for more than $450 million in aid to help fund that peace process. { Although } [ List of White House press conferences ] the { White House } [ White House ] readout didn't mention those funds, it did say { Colombia } [ Colombia ] is \"one of our strongest allies in the { Western Hemisphere } [ Western Hemisphere ] {\". } [ Western Hemisphere ] The second call came in early April, when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rang to express his condolences for devastation caused by { mudslides } [ 2017 Puerto Rico mudslides ] in the country.Their first official meeting at the { White House } [ White House ] came in May after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former { Colombian } [ Colombia ] presidents, { Alvaro Uribe } [ \u00c1lvaro Uribe ] and { Andres Pastrana } [ Andr\u00e9s Pastrana ]. The { White House } [ White House ] brushed off the claims, saying the two former { Colombian } [ Colombia ] leaders were invited to the president's { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.Canadian Prime Minister { Justin Trudeau } [ Justin Trudeau ] is one of only a dozen or so world leaders to have visited the { White House } [ White House ] under { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he'll be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the { White House } [ White House ] would only be making \"tweaks\" to its relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. \"We have a very outstanding trade relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. We'll be tweaking it. { We } [ United States ]'ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of { our } [ United States ] countries,\" { Mr } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said after their meeting. Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ], meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting { refugees } [ Refugee ], but said the \"last thing { Canadians } [ Canada ] expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves\".Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ] said he was \"very pleased\" when Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s granted TransCanada Corp the permits to build the { Keystone XL } [ Keystone Pipeline ] pipeline, which his predecessor had blocked. That could prove to be a challenge should the two countries enter { NAFTA } [ North American Free Trade Agreement ] negotiations as Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has suggested. The mood soured somewhat a few weeks later when Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attacked { Canada } [ Canada ] {'s } [ Canada ] protectionist dairy practices, labelling it a \"disgrace\" and prompting a fiery retort from Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ].But in a { tweet } [ Twitter ] marking { Canada } [ Canada ]'s 150th anniversary, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] referred to his { Canadian } [ Canada ] counterpart as his \"new found friend\".Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has long considered renegotiating the { free trade } [ Free trade ] agreement the { US } [ United States ] struck with { South Korea } [ South Korea ] in 2012. He has referred to the agreement as \"a horrible deal\" that has \"destroyed\" the { US } [ United States ]. { South Korea } [ South Korea ] is a major { US } [ United States ] trade partner, with the { US } [ United States ] exchanging about $144.  Before entering the { White House } [ White House ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Donald said of the deal during an interview with { NBC } [ NBC ] in January: \"We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this.\"\"Nothing\" is a little unfair seeing as the { South Koreans } [ South Korea ] pay around $800 million a year to fund the { US } [ United States ] deployment, but his sentiment was clear: Why do we bother?The answer seemed clear after his repeated threats of military action to the { North Korea } [ North Korea ] for conducting further missile tests this year.  In calls with { South Korea } [ South Korea ]'s acting President { Hwang Kyo-ahn } [ Hwang Kyo-ahn ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has \"reiterated our ironclad commitment\" to defend its ally and strengthen \"joint defence capabilities\". He also dispatched Vice President { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ] to { Seoul } [ Seoul ] to show support for { South Korea } [ South Korea ]. During the visit {, } [ Vice President of the United States ] Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] told his hosts: \"We are with you 100 {%. } [ Hypocorism ]\"\" {North Korea } [ North Korea ] would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the { United States } [ United States ] in this region,\" Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] added.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s relationship with Turkey's President { Recep Tayyip Erdogan } [ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ] is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a { Trump Tower } [ Trump Tower (Istanbul) ] complex in { Istanbul } [ Istanbul ] in 2012. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was at the launch of the property, as was Mr { Erdogan } [ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ] (who was prime minister at that point). But tensions were high after Mr { Erdogan } [ Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ]'s { White House } [ White House ] visit in May, when clashes broke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel. Relations have also been strained with the { Nato } [ NATO ] ally by Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s decision to arm the { Syrian Kurds } [ Syrian Kurdistan ] in the battle against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. Turkey views the { YPG } [ Popular Protection Units ] (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the { PKK } [ Kurdistan Workers' Party ], a { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] separatist group.Donald Trump said he had \"very, very good discussions\" with { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] {'s } [ Ukraine ] President { Petro Poroshenko } [ Petro Poroshenko ] during the foreign leader {'s } [ Ukraine ] { White House } [ White House ] visit in late June.Later in July, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] called on { Russia } [ Russia ] to stop \"destabilising\" { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and \"join the community of responsible nations\". The { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ] brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] of having been weak on { Russia } [ Russia ] and allowing them to \"pick off\" the { Crimean } [ Crimea ] peninsula from { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ]. The { US } [ United States ] president's calls for better ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] have worried { Ukrainian } [ Ukraine ] authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against { Russia } [ Russia ] for its role in the conflicts in { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] would remain even after his meeting with President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].The Crown Prince Sheikh { Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan } [ Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ] spoke with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new { US } [ United States ] president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the { White House } [ White House ], the { crown prince } [ Crown prince ] backed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s idea of safe zones for refugees in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ]. The { UAE } [ United Arab Emirates ] was not one of the countries that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] tried to ban people travelling to the { US } [ United States ] from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few { Middle East } [ Middle East ] officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] proposed ban as a \"sovereign decision\" and said some of the countries on the list \"face structural problems\" that need to be dealt with.Afghanistan has been near the top of every { president } [ President of Afghanistan ]'s in-tray since { US } [ United States ] forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly described the war in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] as a \"disaster\" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so { US } [ United States ] troops out of the country. But after a phone call with his { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] counterpart { Ashraf Ghani } [ Ashraf Ghani ] in December, officials in { Kabul } [ Kabul ] said President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had agreed to consider bolstering the US contingent there. The { US } [ United States ] has taken significant military action there in recent weeks and reportedly plans to send nearly 4,000 additional { US } [ United States ] troops, according to an { AP } [ Associated Press ] report last month.On the 12 April, the { US } [ United States ] used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]'s border with { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] that was said to have been used by the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS).Around 100 { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised his armed forces for \"another successful job\". { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in { Kabul } [ Kabul ], but former President { Hamid Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ] said the country should not be used as a \"testing ground for new and dangerous weapons\". Although Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has only spoken to { President } [ President of Afghanistan ] { Ghani } [ Ashraf Ghani ] once since coming into office, he has said that he intends to meet with his { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] counterpart in the near future. What will { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] do about { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]?UK Prime Minister { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] was the first foreign leader to be welcomed to the { White House } [ White House ] by President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of Pakistan ] got some signs that { President } [ President of Pakistan ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] would be open to negotiating a trade deal with the UK after it leaves the { European Union } [ European Union ], though there was no firm guarantee.  \"Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in { commerce } [ Commerce ] {, } [ Commerce ] business { and } [ Business ] foreign affairs,\" he said at their joint press conference {. } [ Commerce ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted the invitation Mrs { May } [ May government ] extended from the { Queen } [ Elizabeth II ] for a { state visit } [ State visit ], but the prospect stirred controversy back in the UK. Nearly two million people signed one of a number of { petitions } [ Petition ] calling to withdraw Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] invite {. } [ Donald Trump ] The { US } [ United States ] president reportedly changed his mind and is now expected to travel to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] in 2018, the { BBC } [ BBC ] understands.He came under criticism for attacking { London } [ London ] Mayor { Sadiq Khan } [ Sadiq Khan ] over his response to recent terror attacks. Her pivotal role in global politics can be seen clearly on the { White House } [ White House ] call sheet - { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has spoken to her more than any other foreign leader and she also paid the new { president } [ President of the United States ] a visit in March. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] tone towards Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] has changed significantly since he took office though. The { German } [ Germany ] leader clearly noticed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she {'s } [ Donald Trump ] \"always said it {'s } [ Donald Trump ] much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another\". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] was unimpressed with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] command of policy details.After Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] pulled out of the Paris climate deal at the { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit, Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] said { Europe } [ Europe ] could no longer \"completely depend\" on the { US } [ United States ] and { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and should \"take their destiny into their own hands\".Japan's Prime Minister { Shinzo Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] arrived in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ] on 9 February for a meeting with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. They held a joint press conference in which Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said the { US } [ United States ] is committed to further strengthening the \"very crucial alliance\" - but the highlight of the visit for the media was the president's uncomfortably long handshake and Mr { Abe } [ Nobuhito Abe ] {'s } [ Nobuhito Abe ] reaction to it. After talks in the capital, the pair jetted off with their wives to spend the weekend at Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] and the two men went for a round of { golf } [ Golf ]. Their weekend was interrupted by news that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] had conducted a missile test - and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was criticised after images appeared to show them discussing the incident in a public restaurant, raising security concerns. But overall, Mr { Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] will have been pleased with how the trip went and other world leaders are likely to use his visit as a template for building a relationship with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ].The pair reunited on the sidelines of the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit to discuss { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s { nuclear program } [ North Korea and weapons of mass destruction ] in July. Mr { Abe } [ Benjamin Abe ] told Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] the situation \"has become increasingly severe\".He also attended the Arab Islamic American Summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ], which focused on combating { Islamist } [ Islam ] militants and the growing regional influence of { Iran } [ Iran ]. Relations had soured somewhat under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] after his administration's nuclear deal with { Iran } [ Iran ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in a diplomatic standoff with { Qatar } [ Qatar ]. Saudi Arabia and other { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] nations cut off ties with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over allegations that it funds terror groups.But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], quoted by { Reuters } [ Reuters ], told { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] on the matter, \"it's important that the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] be united for peace and security in the region\".Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a \"fantastic guy\" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration and President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the { US } [ United States ] president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is seeking to \"reboot\" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable { Egypt } [ Egypt ] as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group. Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el Sisi ], who wants to ensure { Egypt } [ Egypt ] continues to receive { US } [ United States ] military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] as someone who has a \"deep and great understanding\" of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {. } [ Middle East ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke to President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] by phone on 10 April to offer his condolences for an attack on two churches in the country that killed dozens of people. He also { tweeted } [ Twitter ]: \"I have great confidence that { President } [ President of Egypt ] Al Sisi will handle the situation properly.\"The two again reunited during Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s first foreign visit to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], where the { US } [ United States ] president said he hoped to visit { Cairo } [ Cairo ] soon. At a summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] {, } [ Riyadh ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said \"safety seems to be very strong\" in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] {. } [ Egypt ] He added Mr Sisi had \"done a tremendous job under trying circumstance\".Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also thanked Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] for coordinating the release of { Egyptian-American } [ Egyptian Americans ] charity worker { Aya Hijazi } [ Aya Hijazi ] in April.The { White House } [ White House ] worked behind-the-scenes to secure her release after failed attempts by the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration. An image of Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], Mr { Sisi } [ Abdelaziz Sisi ] and { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz.Canadian Prime Minister { Justin Trudeau } [ Justin Trudeau ] is one of only a dozen or so world leaders to have visited the { White House } [ White House ] under { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he'll be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the { White House } [ White House ] would only be making \"tweaks\" to its relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. \"We have a very outstanding trade relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ].

Turkey views the { YPG } [ Popular Protection Units ] (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the { PKK } [ Kurdistan Workers' Party ], a { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] separatist group.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted an invitation to attend this year's { Bastille Day } [ Bastille Day ] celebrations in { France } [ France ] after a somewhat rocky start with his { French } [ France ] counterpart. { French } [ France ] President { Emmanuel Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May in { Brussels } [ Brussels ] as \"not innocent\". The 39-year-old president also appeared to snub Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] while shaking hands with { Nato } [ NATO ] leaders at the { Brussels } [ Brussels ] summit. Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] has also sharply criticised Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] after he { pulled out } [ United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement ] of the { Paris climate accord } [ Paris Agreement ], mocking the \"America First\" president with a pledge to \"make the planet great again\". Meanwhile, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has been critical of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] security measures in the wake of recent terrorist attacks there. Before Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] was elected in May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in { Paris } [ Paris ] would \"have a big effect\" on the election\".Many thought Mr Trump was referring to { National Front } [ National Rally (France) ] leader { Marie Le Pen } [ Marie Le Pen ], the anti-immigrant and { anti-globalisation } [ Anti-globalization movement ] candidate who lost to Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ]. But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] in a { tweet } [ Twitter ].Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attended the 100th anniversary of { US } [ United States ] entry into { World War One } [ World War I ] on 14 July as well as a series of formal meetings between the two nations.He spoke warmly of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] revolutionary past and the beauty of { Paris } [ Paris ], and said the city {'s } [ France ] future was bright with Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] leading the country.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has long considered renegotiating the { free trade } [ Free trade ] agreement the { US } [ United States ] struck with { South Korea } [ South Korea ] in 2012. He has referred to the agreement as \"a horrible deal\" that has \"destroyed\" the { US } [ United States ]. { South Korea } [ South Korea ] is a major { US } [ United States ] trade partner, with the { US } [ United States ] exchanging about $144.  Before entering the { White House } [ White House ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Donald said of the deal during an interview with { NBC } [ NBC ] in January: \"We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this.\"\"Nothing\" is a little unfair seeing as the { South Koreans } [ South Korea ] pay around $800 million a year to fund the { US } [ United States ] deployment, but his sentiment was clear: Why do we bother?The answer seemed clear after his repeated threats of military action to the { North Korea } [ North Korea ] for conducting further missile tests this year.  In calls with { South Korea } [ South Korea ]'s acting President { Hwang Kyo-ahn } [ Hwang Kyo-ahn ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has \"reiterated our ironclad commitment\" to defend its ally and strengthen \"joint defence capabilities\". He also dispatched Vice President { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ] to { Seoul } [ Seoul ] to show support for { South Korea } [ South Korea ]. During the visit {, } [ Vice President of the United States ] Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] told his hosts: \"We are with you 100 {%. } [ Hypocorism ]\"\" {North Korea } [ North Korea ] would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the { United States } [ United States ] in this region,\" Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] added.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] mentioned { China } [ China ] so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a { meme } [ Meme ]. He repeatedly called the { Communist } [ Communism ] state a \"currency manipulator\" and even accused them of \"raping\" the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] They want to overtake us and if we don't get smart and tough soon, they will.\"But just a few months into his presidency, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] welcomed { Chinese } [ China ] President { Xi Jinping } [ Xi Jinping ] to his { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] with open arms and described the pair's relationship as \"outstanding\". He decided against taking { China } [ China ]'s leader for a round of { golf } [ Golf ] though - Mr Xi has shut down several { golf } [ Golf ] courses since coming into power and banned the { Communist Party } [ Communist Party of China ]'s 88 million members from teeing off. The { White House } [ White House ] released few details about the pair's discussions but the meeting appeared to go well. \"I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\" an optimistic Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters. A few days later he tweeted: \"Why would I call { China } [ China ] a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the { North Korean } [ North Korea ] problem? We will see what happens!\"  But Mr Trump's positive outlook on { China } [ China ] again hardened in June, when he expressed frustration that { China } [ China ] was not doing more to curb { North } [ North Korea ] nuclear ambitions.China, which is { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s main economic ally, and { Russia } [ Russia ] have urged { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] to halt its ballistic missile programme in exchange while also calling for the US and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] to suspend their large-scale military exercises in the region.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to empathise with { China } [ China ], tweeting on 20 June: \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President { Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] & { China } [ China ] to help with { North Korea } [ North Korea ], it has not worked out. At least I know { China } [ China ] tried!\" But the { White House } [ White House ] later angered { Beijing } [ China ] by imposing sanctions on { Chinese } [ China ] businesses that it claimed did business with { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and agreed to new arms sales to { Taiwan } [ Taiwan ].In early July, he expressed impatience with { China } [ China ] after { North Korea } [ North Korea ] launched an { intercontinental ballistic missile } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] {. } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] He tweeted: \"Perhaps { China } [ China ] will put a heavy move on { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and end this nonsense once and for all!\"But when the two world leaders met again at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Germany } [ Germany ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] struck a more conciliatory tone. { \"It's an honour to have you as a friend } [ Friendship ] {,\" he } [ George Harrison ] told { Mr Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] {. } [ George Harrison ] \"As far as { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other.Peruvian { President } [ President of Peru ] { Pedro Pablo Kuczynski } [ Pedro Pablo Kuczynski ] has already had a substantial amount of contact with { President } [ President of Peru ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The two men have spoken twice over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the { White House } [ White House ]. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the { Peruvian } [ Peru ] president is particularly interested in persuading the { US } [ United States ] to deport its fugitive ex-leader { Alejandro Toledo } [ Alejandro Toledo ] {. } [ Alejandro Toledo ] He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] to \"evaluate\" the situation.In May Mr Kuczynski also spoke to Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] about tackling the economic and political crisis in { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ], as well as to thank his { American } [ United States ] counterpart for providing humanitarian assistance in devastating floods in { Peru } [ Peru ].Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is one of many foreign leaders to have held one phone conversation with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The call with the { Qatari } [ Qatar ] emir came in early February amid an attempted travel ban by Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] that affected several { Middle Eastern } [ Middle East ] countries, but not { Qatar } [ Qatar ] itself. The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group, with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] countries cut travel and embassy links with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical { Islamism } [ Islamism ] {. } [ Islamism ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took initial credit for applying pressure on { Qatar } [ Qatar ] in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark \"the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism\". In early June, he again accused { Qatar } [ Qatar ] of funding terrorism, tweeting:\"During my recent trip to the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to { Qatar } [ Qatar ] \u2013 look!\"But { Washington } [ United States ] would stand to benefit most from a resolution with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] as the US ally is home to the largest { American } [ United States ] military facility in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest ally, { Israel } [ Israel ] {. } [ United States ]He was quick to invite Prime Minister { Benjamin Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] to the { White House } [ White House ] and used their joint news conference to talk of the { US } [ United States ] standing firm with { Israel } [ Israel ], \"especially in the face of terrorism\". But he appeared to suggest the decades-old policy of a { two-state solution } [ Two-state solution ] - a { Palestinian } [ State of Palestine ] state living peacefully alongside { Israel } [ Israel ] - may not be the answer when he told journalists: \"I'm looking at two states and one state.\"He backtracked slightly a couple of days later in an interview with { Reuters } [ Reuters ], saying: \"I like this { two-state } [ Two-state solution ] solution, but I am satisfied with whatever both parties agree with.\"His administration caused another stir by saying { Israeli } [ Israel ] settlements were not \"an impediment to peace\", a change to the policy under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later told an { Israeli } [ Israel ] newspaper that settlements \"don't help the peace process\". In a speech on the eve of his { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] turned to his daughter's husband and said: \"If you can't produce peace in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] nobody can.\"During a visit to { Tel Aviv } [ Tel Aviv ] in May, he said he came to \"reaffirm the unbreakable bond\" between the { US } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] and that there was a \"rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace\" to the region.No { US } [ United States ] relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] {. } [ Russia ]US intelligence agencies accused { Russia } [ Russia ] of being behind the hacking of the { Democratic Party } [ Democratic Party (United States) ]'s email server and then a dossier emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s ties to Russia } [ Russia\u2013United States relations ]. The president was then forced to fire aide { Mike Flynn } [ Mike Flynn ] after evidence emerged that he spoke to { Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] ambassador to the US about lifting { sanctions } [ International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis ] on the country without being authorised to do so.The { FBI } [ Federal Bureau of Investigation ] has confirmed that it has been investigating alleged { Russian } [ Russia ] interference in the election since July last year, including examining possible links between Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s campaign } [ Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ] and { Moscow } [ Russia ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has dismissed the entire { Russia } [ Russia ] scandal as \"fake news\" and accused { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Mr Trump told the { Christian Broadcasting Network } [ Christian Broadcasting Network ] he gets along \"very well\" with { Russian } [ Russia ] President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ], citing the recent ceasefire in south-western { Syria } [ Syria ] as an example of his co-operation with the { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ]. He also said he directly asked Mr { Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] twice if he meddled in the { US election } [ 2016 United States presidential election ] - to which the { Russian } [ Russia ] president said he did not - at the pair's much-anticipated meeting at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].But he has { tweeted } [ Twitter ] about { Russia } [ Russia ] dozens of times - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.The latest Trump associate to become entangled in the { Russia } [ Russia ] controversy is his son, { Donald Trump Jr } [ Donald Trump Jr. ], who confirmed he met { Russian } [ Russia ] lawyer { Natalia Veselnitskaya } [ Natalia Veselnitskaya ] on June 9 2016 after being told that she had damaging material on { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Russia: The scandal { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] can't shakeAfghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since { US } [ United States ] forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly described the war in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] as a \"disaster\" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so { US } [ United States ] troops out of the country. But after a phone call with his { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] counterpart { Ashraf Ghani } [ Ashraf Ghani ] in December, officials in { Kabul } [ Kabul ] said President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had agreed to consider bolstering the US contingent there. The { US } [ United States ] has taken significant military action there in recent weeks and reportedly plans to send nearly 4,000 additional { US } [ United States ] troops, according to an { AP } [ Associated Press ] report last month.On the 12 April, the { US } [ United States ] used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]'s border with { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] that was said to have been used by the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS).Around 100 { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised his armed forces for \"another successful job\". { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in { Kabul } [ Kabul ], but former President { Hamid Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ] said the country should not be used as a \"testing ground for new and dangerous weapons\". Although Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has only spoken to { President } [ President of Afghanistan ] { Ghani } [ Ashraf Ghani ] once since coming into office, he has said that he intends to meet with his { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] counterpart in the near future. What will { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] do about { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]? {Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] made defeating the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so { Iraq } [ Iraq ] is central to his foreign policy objectives. However, his relationship with { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries, including { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. The ban was eventually blocked by { US } [ United States ] judges, and when the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] Prime Minister { Haider al-Abadi } [ Haider al-Abadi ] spoke to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of { Mosul } [ Mosul ] from { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the { US } [ United States ] a few weeks later for a meeting at the { White House } [ White House ], when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters: \"Our main thrust is we have to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. We're going to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] It will happen. It's happening right now. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] congratulated his { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] counterpart, saying { Mosul } [ Mosul ] had been \"liberated from its long nightmare\" under the rule of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ].The Crown Prince Sheikh { Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan } [ Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ] spoke with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] on the phone just a few days after the former businessman became the new { US } [ United States ] president. The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the { White House } [ White House ], the { crown prince } [ Crown prince ] backed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s idea of safe zones for refugees in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ]. The { UAE } [ United Arab Emirates ] was not one of the countries that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] tried to ban people travelling to the { US } [ United States ] from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few { Middle East } [ Middle East ] officials to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan described Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] proposed ban as a \"sovereign decision\" and said some of the countries on the list \"face structural problems\" that need to be dealt with.Colombian President { Juan Manuel Santos } [ Juan Manuel Santos ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] in May and had previously spoken to his { US } [ United States ] counterpart twice by phone since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took office.The first call came in mid-February, with the pair discussing the { Colombian } [ Colombia ] government's { peace process } [ Colombian peace process ] with the { Farc } [ Farc ] rebel group. President { Santos } [ Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo ] was no doubt eager for signs that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] will back a promise by his predecessor to ask the { US Congress } [ United States Congress ] for more than $450 million in aid to help fund that peace process. { Although } [ List of White House press conferences ] the { White House } [ White House ] readout didn't mention those funds, it did say { Colombia } [ Colombia ] is \"one of our strongest allies in the { Western Hemisphere } [ Western Hemisphere ] {\". } [ Western Hemisphere ] The second call came in early April, when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rang to express his condolences for devastation caused by { mudslides } [ 2017 Puerto Rico mudslides ] in the country.Their first official meeting at the { White House } [ White House ] came in May after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former { Colombian } [ Colombia ] presidents, { Alvaro Uribe } [ \u00c1lvaro Uribe ] and { Andres Pastrana } [ Andr\u00e9s Pastrana ]. The { White House } [ White House ] brushed off the claims, saying the two former { Colombian } [ Colombia ] leaders were invited to the president's { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] met Prime Minister { Narendra Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] for the first time in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] { DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], in late June. The two leaders, who shared a warm embrace in front of reporters, vowed to fight { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] together, praised { US-India relations } [ India\u2013United States relations ] and issued a warning to { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. \"The relationship between { India } [ India ] and the { United States } [ United States ] has never been stronger, never been better,\" said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who describes himself and Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] as \"world leaders in social media\".Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] was also the first foreign dignitary to dine with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] Prior to the meeting {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke by phone with Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] twice. The first call happened just a couple of days after Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] The pair agreed they must stand \"shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism\" and { President } [ President of India ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] invited Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] to the { White House } [ White House ] later in 2017. The { US } [ United States ] president also rang { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of India ] { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] at the end of March to congratulate him on his party's good showing in state-level elections in { India } [ India ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has twice met { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] { Joko Widodo } [ Joko Widodo ] while abroad. Both leaders attended the { Riyadh Summit } [ May 2017 Riyadh summit ] in { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in May, but did not have their first one-on-one until the { G20 } [ July 2017 G20 Riyadh summit ] summit in July. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he expected to do a lot of trade deals and business with { Indonesia } [ Indonesia ] during the { G20 } [ G20 ] meeting. While Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration, { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and his relationship with the new president has raised eyebrows in the { US } [ United States ]. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] Hotel in { West Java } [ West Java ] and another resort in { Bali } [ Bali ] and recently told an { Indonesian } [ Indonesia ] magazine that he has \"close access\" to the { US } [ United States ] president.At the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had a social media snafu that mistakenly identified { Singaporean } [ Singapore ] Prime Minister { Lee Hsien Loong } [ Lee Hsien Loong ] as Mr Widodo.The mistake sparked online backlash but was later fixed.Jordan's { King Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was the first { Arab } [ Arab world ] leader to meet { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he is also the only foreign leader to have met him more than once so far. The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the { National Prayer Breakfast } [ National Prayer Breakfast ], an annual event held in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King { Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was invited back to the capital in April for an official meeting with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. { Jordan } [ Jordan ] is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised the king and his armed forces for their help. \" {Jordanian } [ Jordan ] service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. The two men also talked about the civil war in { Syria } [ Syria ] and it was in their joint press conference that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] described a chemical attack on a rebel-held town as a \"heinous action\" by the { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] regime that \"cannot be tolerated\". Two days later the US responded by launching a missile strike on a military airfield in { Syria } [ Syria ]. In early July, { Jordan } [ Jordan ] agreed to coordinate with the US and { Russia } [ Russia ] to put in place a ceasefire across south-western { Syria } [ Syria ].US relations with { Kenya } [ Kenya ] are likely to be very different under { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] to how they were under { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ], whose father was { Kenyan } [ Kenya ]. Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - { Egypt } [ Egypt ], { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ] and { South Africa } [ South Africa ] - before speaking to { Kenya } [ Kenya ]'s President { Uhuru Kenyatta } [ Uhuru Kenyatta ] was taken as a snub by some in the country. The two leaders discussed security in the region and President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised { Kenya } [ Kenya ]'s \"significant contributions\" to the { African Union } [ African Union ] force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring { Somalia } [ Somalia ]. The { US } [ United States ] in May suspended $21m of funding to { Kenya } [ Kenya ]'s ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. { Kenya } [ Kenya ] has said it would strengthen its { accounting } [ Accounting ] {. } [ Kenya ]President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] met the emir of { Kuwait } [ Kuwait ], Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ].The pair previously spoke by { phone } [ Telephone ] at the beginning of February.When { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] announced a ban on people entering the { US } [ United States ] from several predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries, some analysts were surprised not to see { Tunisia } [ Tunisia ] on the list. The { Arab Spring } [ Arab Spring ] began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] than any other nationality. President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with { Tunisian } [ Tunisia ] President { Beji Caid Essebsi } [ Beji Caid Essebsi ] is important in the fight against { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and he praised the country's \"stability and security\" in a phone call with its leader in February.No { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting \"Build the wall, build the wall!\" It was the policy that defined Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who has said repeatedly that { Mexico } [ Mexico ] will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States barrier ] in an { executive order } [ Executive order ] signed on 25 January. But just two days later, { Mexican } [ Mexico ] President { Enrique Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: \"I've said time and again: { Mexico } [ Mexico ] won't pay for any { wall } [ Trump wall ].\" Mr { Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] was due to go to the { White House } [ White House ] for a meeting, but he cancelled the trip and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said it would have been \"fruitless\" if { Mexico } [ Mexico ] didn't treat the { US } [ United States ] \"with respect\".One idea to pay for the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] that President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] floated was a tax on goods imported from { Mexico } [ Mexico ] but that appeared to be dropped after it was criticised by politicians on both sides of the border.Construction on the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] is yet to start because Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] needs { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the { border } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] have been given more power.How realistic is { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s wall? {New Zealand } [ New Zealand ]'s Prime Minister { Bill English } [ Bill English ] has spoken to { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] once over the phone so far. The call happened on 5 February. A short { White House } [ White House ] summary of the call said the two leaders had \"affirmed the close friendship\" between the countries and discussed \"peace and security\".Prime Minister { English } [ Bill English ] gave a little more detail to reporters in { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ] {. } [ Bill English ] He said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was \"warm, civil and very thoughtful\" and that they discussed topics from { immigration } [ Immigration ] bans to the { Super Bowl } [ Super Bowl ] {. } [ Super Bowl ]\"He has a more casual attitude to diplomatic relationships than is usual,\" Mr { English } [ English people ] told the { New Zealand Herald } [ The New Zealand Herald ], adding that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he is welcome at the { White House } [ White House ] \"if you're passing by\".Argentina's President { Mauricio Macri } [ Mauricio Macri ] is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] dates back decades to when he and { his father } [ Juan Manuel de Oliveira Macri ] were doing business in 1980s { New York } [ New York City ].That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr { Macri } [ Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Macri ] called the { US } [ United States ] { president-elect } [ President-elect of the United States ] last November to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in { Argentina } [ Argentina ], Mr Trump asked the { Argentine } [ Argentina ] for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in { Buenos Aires } [ Buenos Aires ] - a claim both men denied. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr { Macri } [ Rodrigo Macri ] to the { White House } [ White House ], and he is the last leader to meet him in person during his { first 100 days } [ First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency ].Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, { Trinidad and Tobago } [ Trinidad and Tobago ] Prime Minister { Keith Rowley } [ Keith Rowley ] spoke to { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] on the phone in February to discuss \"shared priorities\". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some { US } [ United States ] officials worried that the small { Caribbean } [ Caribbean ] island could become a \"breeding ground for extremists\", according to the { New York Times } [ The New York Times ]. The island's former US ambassador { John Estrada } [ John Estrada ] told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ].President { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] called { Thailand } [ Thailand ]'s Prime Minister { Prayut Chan-ocha } [ Prayut Chan-ocha ], who took control of the country in a { 2014 coup } [ 2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat ], to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the { US } [ United States ] had been somewhat strained in the past because of { human rights } [ Human rights ] complaints.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] seems to have warmer feelings toward { Thailand } [ Thailand ]'s { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] {. } [ Prime minister ] According to a { White House } [ White House ] statement {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] the two leaders discussed \"a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries.\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr { Chan-ocha } [ Chan-ocha ] to visit the { White House } [ White House ] for the first time since Mr { Chan-ocha } [ Chan-ocha ] assumed power.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] first met President { Mahmoud Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] during the { Palestinian Authority } [ Palestinian National Authority ] leader's { White House } [ White House ] visit at the beginning of May. He said there was a \"very good chance\" of a { Middle East } [ Middle East ] peace deal, telling Mr { Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] during a joint news conference: \"We will get this done\".During a visit to { Bethlehem } [ Bethlehem ] to meet Mr Abbas again on 23 May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he would \"do everything\" to help { Israelis } [ Israel ] and { Palestinians } [ State of Palestine ] achieve peace. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also said that he was \"gratified\" that Mr { Abbas } [ Mahmoud Abbas ] had attended the summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] and \"committed to taking firm but necessary steps to fight terrorism and confront its hateful ideology\".President Trump met President { Juan Carlos Varela } [ Juan Carlos Varela ] of { Panama } [ Panama ] in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] focus on the { Panama Canal } [ Panama Canal ] {, } [ Panama Canal ] which was opened by the { US } [ United States ] in 1914. \"The { Panama Canal } [ Panama Canal ] is doing quite well,\" he said at the { White House } [ White House ] meeting. \"I think we did a good job building it.\"Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also praised US-Panama relations, saying \"things are going well\" and \"the relationship has been very strong\".Donald Trump said he had \"very, very good discussions\" with { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] {'s } [ Ukraine ] President { Petro Poroshenko } [ Petro Poroshenko ] during the foreign leader {'s } [ Ukraine ] { White House } [ White House ] visit in late June.Later in July, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] called on { Russia } [ Russia ] to stop \"destabilising\" { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and \"join the community of responsible nations\". The { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ] brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] of having been weak on { Russia } [ Russia ] and allowing them to \"pick off\" the { Crimean } [ Crimea ] peninsula from { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ]. The { US } [ United States ] president's calls for better ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] have worried { Ukrainian } [ Ukraine ] authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against { Russia } [ Russia ] for its role in the conflicts in { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] would remain even after his meeting with President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].President { Rodrigo Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] had a \"very friendly conversation\" with Trump on 29 April, in which they discussed { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and \"the fact that the { Philippine } [ Philippines ] government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.\" Mr { Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] has been widely criticized for { human rights } [ Human rights ] violations in the { Philippines } [ Philippines ] {. } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] He has authorised { police } [ Police ] and { vigilantes } [ Vigilantism ] to maim and kill drug users on the streets of { Manila } [ Manila ]. His relationship with the { US } [ United States ] had been rocky in the past, in part because former { President } [ President of the United States ] { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] criticized the { extrajudicial executions } [ Extrajudicial killing ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] however, has had a warmer relationship with his { Philippine } [ Philippines ] counterpart so far. He invited Mr { Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] to the { White House } [ White House ] and has plans to visit the { Philippines } [ Philippines ] in November for the { East Asia Summit } [ East Asia Summit ] and the US-ASEAN Summit.Mr { Duterte } [ Rodrigo Duterte ] responded by saying he may be too \"tied up\" to accept the { White House } [ White House ] visit.Australia has been one of { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the { US } [ United States ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] entered the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ White House ] Mr Trump was said to have had a \"contentious\" phone call with Prime Minister { Malcolm Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into { Australia } [ Australia ]. A { Washington Post } [ The Washington Post ] report said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the { refugee } [ Refugee ] agreement as \"the worst deal ever\". President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who later publicly criticised the deal as \"dumb\", insisted the phone call had been \"civil\" while Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] said it was a \"very frank and forthright\" conversation.The deal for the refugees, who are said to be mostly from { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], appears to be going ahead with US { Homeland Security } [ United States Department of Homeland Security ] and { State Department } [ United States Department of State ] officials currently examining their cases.Last month footage (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-40284188) leaked to the media showing Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] poking fun at his { US } [ United States ] counterpart at a dinner for media.  Both { US } [ United States ] and { Australia } [ Australia ] dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on { Mexico } [ Mexico ] and the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], but they could also affect thousands of unregistered { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] immigrants in the US.Former { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] Prime Minister { Enda Kenny } [ Enda Kenny ] raised this issue with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] when he visited the { White House } [ White House ] in March, saying there were \"millions out there who want to. make { America } [ United States ] great.\"The { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] traditionally presents the new { US } [ United States ] president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr { Kenny } [ Kenny (title) ] did so while making his views on President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s immigration policies clear. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: \"We love { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] and we love the people of { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {. } [ United States ]\"The president has business interests in { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in the form of a { golf course } [ Golf course ] and resort in { Doonbeg } [ Doonbeg ], { County Clare } [ County Clare ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has yet to meet the newest { Taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] { Leo Varadkar } [ Leo Varadkar ], but the two spoke by phone for about 15 minutes following the young { prime minister } [ Prime minister ]'s confirmation. Mr { Varadkar } [ Varadkar ] was confirmed as { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {'s } [ Republic of Ireland ] youngest and first openly { gay } [ Gay ] leader in June. \"We have so many people from { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in this country - I know so many of them, I feel I know all of them,\" said Mr Trump, who invited the { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] to the { St Patrick's Day } [ Saint Patrick's Day ] celebration in March.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has spoken to { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ]'s President { Muhammadu Buhari } [ Muhammadu Buhari ] by phone once so far, on 15 February. Judging by the { White House } [ White House ] readout, it was a fairly routine conversation. However, one line did cause some controversy: \"President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] expressed support for the sale of aircraft from the { United States } [ United States ] to support { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ]'s fight against { Boko Haram } [ Boko Haram ].The deal needs to be approved by the { US Congress } [ United States Congress ], but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important { human rights } [ Human rights ] concerns are to { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] when it comes to trade.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] caused a bit of a stir about { Sweden } [ Sweden ] during one of his regular attacks on the { media } [ News media ] at a rally in February. \"Look at what's happening last night in { Sweden } [ Sweden ] {. } [ Sweden ] { Sweden } [ Sweden ], who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers of { migrants } [ Immigration ]. { They } [ American Airlines ]'re having problems like { they } [ American Airlines ] never thought possible,\" the new { US } [ United States ] president told the crowd in { Florida } [ Florida ] {. } [ United States ]The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was referring to - not least lots of baffled { Swedes } [ Sweden ]. It later emerged that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had been referring to a report on { Fox News } [ Fox News ] about gun violence and rape in { Sweden } [ Sweden ] since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But { police officers } [ Police officer ] interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or { rape } [ Rape ]. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister { Stefan Lofven } [ Stefan Lofven ] during this saga, he did phone the { Swedish } [ Sweden ] leader in April to express condolences over an attack in { Stockholm } [ Stockholm ] {. } [ Stockholm ]Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about { South Africa } [ South Africa ], tweeting that the country was a \"mess\". Now that he's { president } [ President of South Africa ], however, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is taking a slightly more diplomatic approach and told { President } [ President of South Africa ] { Jacob Zuma } [ Jacob Zuma ] that he hopes to \"expand cooperation and trade\" between the two countries. According to the President { Zuma } [ Jacob Zuma ]'s government, there are 600 { US } [ United States ] companies operating in { South Africa } [ South Africa ] {. } [ United States ]President Trump met { Italy } [ Italy ]'s { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Italy ] { Paolo Gentiloni } [ Paolo Gentiloni ] three times since taking office. He first welcomed the { Italian } [ Italy ] prime minister to the { White House } [ White House ] in April and less than a month later met him twice more before the { G-7 } [ Group of Seven ] in { Italy } [ Italy ]. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also called Mr { Gentiloni } [ Enzo Gentiloni ] in July ahead of the { Group of 20 } [ Group of 20 ] ( {G20 } [ Group of 20 ]) meeting, in which he thanked the { Italian } [ Italy ] PM for hosting the \"exception { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit in May\".Prime Minister { Mariano Rajoy } [ Mariano Rajoy ] has spoken to { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] once on the phone so far, in what appears to have been a short call on 7 February. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] once again \"emphasised the importance of all { Nato } [ NATO ] allies sharing the burden of defence spending\".President Trump met { Singapore } [ Singapore ]'s Prime Minister, { Lee Hsien Loong } [ Lee Hsien Loong ], at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ], { Germany } [ Germany ] in July. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said of { Singapore } [ Singapore ]: \"We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger. Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some { Singapore } [ Singapore ] officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic { protectionism } [ Protectionism ] in { America } [ United States ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also invited Mr Lee to visit the { White House } [ White House ] in an April phone call \"to further strengthen ties\", the { White House } [ White House ] said.No { US } [ United States ] relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] {. } [ Russia ]US intelligence agencies accused { Russia } [ Russia ] of being behind the hacking of the { Democratic Party } [ Democratic Party (United States) ]'s email server and then a dossier emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s ties to Russia } [ Russia\u2013United States relations ]. The president was then forced to fire aide { Mike Flynn } [ Mike Flynn ] after evidence emerged that he spoke to { Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] ambassador to the US about lifting { sanctions } [ International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis ] on the country without being authorised to do so.The { FBI } [ Federal Bureau of Investigation ] has confirmed that it has been investigating alleged { Russian } [ Russia ] interference in the election since July last year, including examining possible links between Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s campaign } [ Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ] and { Moscow } [ Russia ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has dismissed the entire { Russia } [ Russia ] scandal as \"fake news\" and accused { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Mr Trump told the { Christian Broadcasting Network } [ Christian Broadcasting Network ] he gets along \"very well\" with { Russian } [ Russia ] President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ], citing the recent ceasefire in south-western { Syria } [ Syria ] as an example of his co-operation with the { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ]. He also said he directly asked Mr { Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] twice if he meddled in the { US election } [ 2016 United States presidential election ] - to which the { Russian } [ Russia ] president said he did not - at the pair's much-anticipated meeting at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ].But he has { tweeted } [ Twitter ] about { Russia } [ Russia ] dozens of times - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.The latest Trump associate to become entangled in the { Russia } [ Russia ] controversy is his son, { Donald Trump Jr } [ Donald Trump Jr. ], who confirmed he met { Russian } [ Russia ] lawyer { Natalia Veselnitskaya } [ Natalia Veselnitskaya ] on June 9 2016 after being told that she had damaging material on { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ]. Russia: The scandal { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] can't shake {Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] mentioned { China } [ China ] so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a { meme } [ Meme ]. He repeatedly called the { Communist } [ Communism ] state a \"currency manipulator\" and even accused them of \"raping\" the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] They want to overtake us and if we don't get smart and tough soon, they will.\"But just a few months into his presidency, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] welcomed { Chinese } [ China ] President { Xi Jinping } [ Xi Jinping ] to his { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] with open arms and described the pair's relationship as \"outstanding\". He decided against taking { China } [ China ]'s leader for a round of { golf } [ Golf ] though - Mr Xi has shut down several { golf } [ Golf ] courses since coming into power and banned the { Communist Party } [ Communist Party of China ]'s 88 million members from teeing off. The { White House } [ White House ] released few details about the pair's discussions but the meeting appeared to go well. \"I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,\" an optimistic Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters. A few days later he tweeted: \"Why would I call { China } [ China ] a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the { North Korean } [ North Korea ] problem? We will see what happens!\"  But Mr Trump's positive outlook on { China } [ China ] again hardened in June, when he expressed frustration that { China } [ China ] was not doing more to curb { North } [ North Korea ] nuclear ambitions.China, which is { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s main economic ally, and { Russia } [ Russia ] have urged { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] to halt its ballistic missile programme in exchange while also calling for the US and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] to suspend their large-scale military exercises in the region.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to empathise with { China } [ China ], tweeting on 20 June: \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President { Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] & { China } [ China ] to help with { North Korea } [ North Korea ], it has not worked out. At least I know { China } [ China ] tried!\" But the { White House } [ White House ] later angered { Beijing } [ China ] by imposing sanctions on { Chinese } [ China ] businesses that it claimed did business with { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and agreed to new arms sales to { Taiwan } [ Taiwan ].In early July, he expressed impatience with { China } [ China ] after { North Korea } [ North Korea ] launched an { intercontinental ballistic missile } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] {. } [ Intercontinental ballistic missile ] He tweeted: \"Perhaps { China } [ China ] will put a heavy move on { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and end this nonsense once and for all!\"But when the two world leaders met again at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Germany } [ Germany ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] struck a more conciliatory tone. { \"It's an honour to have you as a friend } [ Friendship ] {,\" he } [ George Harrison ] told { Mr Xi } [ Xi Jinping ] {. } [ George Harrison ] \"As far as { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is concerned, we will have, eventually, success. It may take longer than I'd like. It may take longer than you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is unlikely to be meeting or even calling { North Korean } [ North Korea ] leader { Kim Jong-un } [ Kim Jong-un ] any time soon, but the young leader has been the subject of some increasingly heated rhetoric from the { US } [ United States ] in recent months.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is angry that the { North Koreans } [ North Korea ] continue to pursue their nuclear ambitions with little consequence and he has sought to put pressure on { China } [ China ] to try to contain its neighbour.His comments follow those of { US } [ United States ] ambassador to the UN { Nikki Haley } [ Nikki Haley ], who said the { US } [ United States ] was willing to use its \"considerable military forces\" on { North Korea } [ North Korea ] \"if we must\".North Korean Vice Foreign Minister { Han Song-ryol } [ Han Song-ryol ] has previously told the { BBC } [ BBC ]: \"If the { US } [ United States ] is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike.\" { China } [ China ], meanwhile, has reiterated its call for { North Korea } [ North Korea ] to stop all missile tests and called for both sides to \"avoid taking provocative actions that pour oil on the fire\".The { US } [ United States ] and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] have flexed their military muscle, firing missiles into the { Sea of Japan } [ Sea of Japan ] and ramping up military drills. { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] said it would not negotiate its weapons programme unless the { US } [ United States ] ended its \"hostile policy\" against { North Korea } [ North Korea ].Tensions with the { US } [ United States ] have escalated since the death of a { US } [ United States ] student who had been jailed in { North Korea } [ North Korea ] for more than 15 months. { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] returned Mr { Warmbier } [ Otto Warmbier ] to the { US } [ United States ] in June on humanitarian grounds, saying he had been in a { coma } [ Coma ] for a year. The 22-year-old died less than a week later.Japan's Prime Minister { Shinzo Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] arrived in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ] on 9 February for a meeting with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. They held a joint press conference in which Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said the { US } [ United States ] is committed to further strengthening the \"very crucial alliance\" - but the highlight of the visit for the media was the president's uncomfortably long handshake and Mr { Abe } [ Nobuhito Abe ] {'s } [ Nobuhito Abe ] reaction to it. After talks in the capital, the pair jetted off with their wives to spend the weekend at Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s { Mar-a-Lago } [ Mar-a-Lago ] retreat in { Florida } [ Florida ] and the two men went for a round of { golf } [ Golf ]. Their weekend was interrupted by news that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] had conducted a missile test - and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was criticised after images appeared to show them discussing the incident in a public restaurant, raising security concerns. But overall, Mr { Abe } [ Shinz\u014d Abe ] will have been pleased with how the trip went and other world leaders are likely to use his visit as a template for building a relationship with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ].The pair reunited on the sidelines of the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit to discuss { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s { nuclear program } [ North Korea and weapons of mass destruction ] in July. Mr { Abe } [ Benjamin Abe ] told Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] the situation \"has become increasingly severe\".No { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting \"Build the wall, build the wall!\" It was the policy that defined Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who has said repeatedly that { Mexico } [ Mexico ] will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States barrier ] in an { executive order } [ Executive order ] signed on 25 January. But just two days later, { Mexican } [ Mexico ] President { Enrique Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: \"I've said time and again: { Mexico } [ Mexico ] won't pay for any { wall } [ Trump wall ].\" Mr { Pena Nieto } [ Enrique Pena Nieto ] was due to go to the { White House } [ White House ] for a meeting, but he cancelled the trip and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said it would have been \"fruitless\" if { Mexico } [ Mexico ] didn't treat the { US } [ United States ] \"with respect\".One idea to pay for the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] that President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] floated was a tax on goods imported from { Mexico } [ Mexico ] but that appeared to be dropped after it was criticised by politicians on both sides of the border.Construction on the { wall } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] is yet to start because Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] needs { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the { border } [ Mexico\u2013United States border ] have been given more power.How realistic is { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s wall? {Syria } [ Syria ] is another country that { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the { US } [ United States ] president. When his { predecessor } [ Barack Obama ] was considering military action in { Syria } [ Syria ] back in 2013, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was a vocal critic against intervention.\"Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack { Syria } [ Syria ] - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the { US } [ United States ] gets nothing,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] { tweeted } [ Twitter ] in September 2013. But just over two months into his presidency, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by { Syrian } [ Syria ] forces that he was taking military action. \"Using a deadly nerve agent, { Syrian } [ Syria ] President { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. \"No child of { God } [ God ] should ever suffer such horror.\"Two { US Navy } [ United States Navy ] ships fired 59 { Tomahawk } [ Tomahawk (missile) ] cruise missiles at a { Syrian } [ Syria ] air base from their positions in the { Mediterranean } [ Mediterranean Sea ]. It was the first direct { US } [ United States ] military action against the { Syrian } [ Syria ] president's forces.More recently, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has touted a ceasefire in the south-western part of { Syria } [ Syria ] brokered by the { US } [ United States ] and { Russia } [ Russia ].The { ceasefire } [ Ceasefire ] is in force along a line agreed by { Syrian } [ Syria ] government forces, which are supported by { Russia } [ Russia ], and the US-backed rebels.Canadian Prime Minister { Justin Trudeau } [ Justin Trudeau ] is one of only a dozen or so world leaders to have visited the { White House } [ White House ] under { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he'll be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s fierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the { White House } [ White House ] would only be making \"tweaks\" to its relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. \"We have a very outstanding trade relationship with { Canada } [ Canada ]. We'll be tweaking it. { We } [ United States ]'ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of { our } [ United States ] countries,\" { Mr } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said after their meeting. Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ], meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting { refugees } [ Refugee ], but said the \"last thing { Canadians } [ Canada ] expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves\".Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ] said he was \"very pleased\" when Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s granted TransCanada Corp the permits to build the { Keystone XL } [ Keystone Pipeline ] pipeline, which his predecessor had blocked. That could prove to be a challenge should the two countries enter { NAFTA } [ North American Free Trade Agreement ] negotiations as Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has suggested. The mood soured somewhat a few weeks later when Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attacked { Canada } [ Canada ] {'s } [ Canada ] protectionist dairy practices, labelling it a \"disgrace\" and prompting a fiery retort from Mr { Trudeau } [ Pierre Trudeau ].But in a { tweet } [ Twitter ] marking { Canada } [ Canada ]'s 150th anniversary, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] referred to his { Canadian } [ Canada ] counterpart as his \"new found friend\".While { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] hasn't spoken to { Iran } [ Iran ] {'s } [ Iran ] leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ] One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a { ballistic missile } [ Ballistic missile ] test, which { Tehran } [ Iran ] said had not violated a { UN } [ United Nations ] resolution on its nuclear activities.Although Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has called that UN agreement \"a terrible deal\", he is unlikely to be able to change it because it was also agreed to by the UK, { France } [ France ], { China } [ China ], { Russia } [ Russia ] and { Germany } [ Germany ]. In April, the US confirmed that { Tehran } [ Iran ] was complying with the deal, but Secretary of State { Rex Tillerson } [ Rex Tillerson ] said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had ordered a review into it nonetheless. The rhetoric of the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration has been predictably confrontational towards { Iran } [ Iran ], with Defence Secretary { James Mattis } [ James Mattis ] calling it the world's \"biggest state sponsor of terrorism\".During a trip to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], the { US } [ United States ] president blamed { Iran } [ Iran ] for instability in the region. President Trump also told { Israeli } [ Israel ] Prime Minister { Benjamin Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] in { Jerusalem } [ Jerusalem ] that { Iran } [ Iran ] \"will never have nuclear weapons\". Why has { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] been so harsh on { Iran } [ Iran ]? {Australia } [ Australia ] has been one of { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] entered the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ White House ] Mr Trump was said to have had a \"contentious\" phone call with Prime Minister { Malcolm Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into { Australia } [ Australia ]. A { Washington Post } [ The Washington Post ] report said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the { refugee } [ Refugee ] agreement as \"the worst deal ever\". President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who later publicly criticised the deal as \"dumb\", insisted the phone call had been \"civil\" while Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] said it was a \"very frank and forthright\" conversation.The deal for the refugees, who are said to be mostly from { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], appears to be going ahead with US { Homeland Security } [ United States Department of Homeland Security ] and { State Department } [ United States Department of State ] officials currently examining their cases.Last month footage (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-40284188) leaked to the media showing Mr { Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] poking fun at his { US } [ United States ] counterpart at a dinner for media.  Both { US } [ United States ] and { Australia } [ Australia ] dismissed the incident as harmless fun.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is a big fan of { Poland } [ Poland ] and { its people } [ Poles ] {. } [ Polish people ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke of \"the triumph of the { Polish } [ Poland ] spirit over centuries of hardship\" as an inspiration \"for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war\" during his speech in { Warsaw } [ Warsaw ] {. } [ Warsaw ]He also thanked the country for buying { Patriot } [ MIM-104 Patriot ] missile defence systems from the { US } [ United States ] in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the { Nato } [ NATO ] alliance. \" {America } [ United States ] loves { Poland } [ Poland ], and { America } [ United States ] loves the { Polish } [ Poland ] people,\" he declared.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] closest ally, { Israel } [ Israel ] {. } [ United States ]He was quick to invite Prime Minister { Benjamin Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] to the { White House } [ White House ] and used their joint news conference to talk of the { US } [ United States ] standing firm with { Israel } [ Israel ], \"especially in the face of terrorism\". But he appeared to suggest the decades-old policy of a { two-state solution } [ Two-state solution ] - a { Palestinian } [ State of Palestine ] state living peacefully alongside { Israel } [ Israel ] - may not be the answer when he told journalists: \"I'm looking at two states and one state.\"He backtracked slightly a couple of days later in an interview with { Reuters } [ Reuters ], saying: \"I like this { two-state } [ Two-state solution ] solution, but I am satisfied with whatever both parties agree with.\"His administration caused another stir by saying { Israeli } [ Israel ] settlements were not \"an impediment to peace\", a change to the policy under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later told an { Israeli } [ Israel ] newspaper that settlements \"don't help the peace process\". In a speech on the eve of his { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] turned to his daughter's husband and said: \"If you can't produce peace in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] nobody can.\"During a visit to { Tel Aviv } [ Tel Aviv ] in May, he said he came to \"reaffirm the unbreakable bond\" between the { US } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] and that there was a \"rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace\" to the region.President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted an invitation to attend this year's { Bastille Day } [ Bastille Day ] celebrations in { France } [ France ] after a somewhat rocky start with his { French } [ France ] counterpart. { French } [ France ] President { Emmanuel Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] described his white-knuckled handshake with Mr Trump at their first meeting in May in { Brussels } [ Brussels ] as \"not innocent\". The 39-year-old president also appeared to snub Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] while shaking hands with { Nato } [ NATO ] leaders at the { Brussels } [ Brussels ] summit. Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] has also sharply criticised Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] after he { pulled out } [ United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement ] of the { Paris climate accord } [ Paris Agreement ], mocking the \"America First\" president with a pledge to \"make the planet great again\". Meanwhile, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has been critical of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] security measures in the wake of recent terrorist attacks there. Before Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] was elected in May, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in { Paris } [ Paris ] would \"have a big effect\" on the election\".Many thought Mr Trump was referring to { National Front } [ National Rally (France) ] leader { Marie Le Pen } [ Marie Le Pen ], the anti-immigrant and { anti-globalisation } [ Anti-globalization movement ] candidate who lost to Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ]. But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] in a { tweet } [ Twitter ].Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] attended the 100th anniversary of { US } [ United States ] entry into { World War One } [ World War I ] on 14 July as well as a series of formal meetings between the two nations.He spoke warmly of { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] revolutionary past and the beauty of { Paris } [ Paris ], and said the city {'s } [ France ] future was bright with Mr { Macron } [ Emmanuel Macron ] leading the country. Her pivotal role in global politics can be seen clearly on the { White House } [ White House ] call sheet - { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has spoken to her more than any other foreign leader and she also paid the new { president } [ President of the United States ] a visit in March. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] tone towards Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] has changed significantly since he took office though. The { German } [ Germany ] leader clearly noticed Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she {'s } [ Donald Trump ] \"always said it {'s } [ Donald Trump ] much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another\". The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit with one eye-catching moment of awkwardness - but some reports suggested Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] was unimpressed with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] command of policy details.After Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] pulled out of the Paris climate deal at the { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit, Mrs { Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ] said { Europe } [ Europe ] could no longer \"completely depend\" on the { US } [ United States ] and { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and should \"take their destiny into their own hands\".He also attended the Arab Islamic American Summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ], which focused on combating { Islamist } [ Islam ] militants and the growing regional influence of { Iran } [ Iran ]. Relations had soured somewhat under President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] after his administration's nuclear deal with { Iran } [ Iran ], but Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] in a diplomatic standoff with { Qatar } [ Qatar ]. Saudi Arabia and other { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] nations cut off ties with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over allegations that it funds terror groups.But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], quoted by { Reuters } [ Reuters ], told { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] on the matter, \"it's important that the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] be united for peace and security in the region\".Jordan's { King Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was the first { Arab } [ Arab world ] leader to meet { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and he is also the only foreign leader to have met him more than once so far. The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the { National Prayer Breakfast } [ National Prayer Breakfast ], an annual event held in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King { Abdullah } [ Abdullah of Jordan ] was invited back to the capital in April for an official meeting with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ]. { Jordan } [ Jordan ] is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] praised the king and his armed forces for their help. \" {Jordanian } [ Jordan ] service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,\" Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. The two men also talked about the civil war in { Syria } [ Syria ] and it was in their joint press conference that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] described a chemical attack on a rebel-held town as a \"heinous action\" by the { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] regime that \"cannot be tolerated\". Two days later the US responded by launching a missile strike on a military airfield in { Syria } [ Syria ]. In early July, { Jordan } [ Jordan ] agreed to coordinate with the US and { Russia } [ Russia ] to put in place a ceasefire across south-western { Syria } [ Syria ].Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a \"fantastic guy\" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship has continued since Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] inauguration and President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ] visited the { White House } [ White House ] at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] in 2013. Human rights groups, however, have criticised the { US } [ United States ] president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is seeking to \"reboot\" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable { Egypt } [ Egypt ] as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group. Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah el Sisi ], who wants to ensure { Egypt } [ Egypt ] continues to receive { US } [ United States ] military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] as someone who has a \"deep and great understanding\" of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {. } [ Middle East ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke to President { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] by phone on 10 April to offer his condolences for an attack on two churches in the country that killed dozens of people. He also { tweeted } [ Twitter ]: \"I have great confidence that { President } [ President of Egypt ] Al Sisi will handle the situation properly.\"The two again reunited during Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s first foreign visit to { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], where the { US } [ United States ] president said he hoped to visit { Cairo } [ Cairo ] soon. At a summit in { Riyadh } [ Riyadh ] {, } [ Riyadh ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said \"safety seems to be very strong\" in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] {. } [ Egypt ] He added Mr Sisi had \"done a tremendous job under trying circumstance\".Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also thanked Mr { Sisi } [ Abdel Fattah Sisi ] for coordinating the release of { Egyptian-American } [ Egyptian Americans ] charity worker { Aya Hijazi } [ Aya Hijazi ] in April.The { White House } [ White House ] worked behind-the-scenes to secure her release after failed attempts by the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration. An image of Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], Mr { Sisi } [ Abdelaziz Sisi ] and { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] King { Salman } [ Salman of Saudi Arabia ] placing their hands on a glowing orb at the meeting also set social media abuzz.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has long considered renegotiating the { free trade } [ Free trade ] agreement the { US } [ United States ] struck with { South Korea } [ South Korea ] in 2012. He has referred to the agreement as \"a horrible deal\" that has \"destroyed\" the { US } [ United States ]. { South Korea } [ South Korea ] is a major { US } [ United States ] trade partner, with the { US } [ United States ] exchanging about $144.  Before entering the { White House } [ White House ] {, } [ Donald Trump ] Donald said of the deal during an interview with { NBC } [ NBC ] in January: \"We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this.\"\"Nothing\" is a little unfair seeing as the { South Koreans } [ South Korea ] pay around $800 million a year to fund the { US } [ United States ] deployment, but his sentiment was clear: Why do we bother?The answer seemed clear after his repeated threats of military action to the { North Korea } [ North Korea ] for conducting further missile tests this year.  In calls with { South Korea } [ South Korea ]'s acting President { Hwang Kyo-ahn } [ Hwang Kyo-ahn ], Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has \"reiterated our ironclad commitment\" to defend its ally and strengthen \"joint defence capabilities\". He also dispatched Vice President { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ] to { Seoul } [ Seoul ] to show support for { South Korea } [ South Korea ]. During the visit {, } [ Vice President of the United States ] Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] told his hosts: \"We are with you 100 {%. } [ Hypocorism ]\"\" {North Korea } [ North Korea ] would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the { United States } [ United States ] in this region,\" Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] added.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] made defeating the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so { Iraq } [ Iraq ] is central to his { foreign policy } [ Foreign policy ] objectives. However, his relationship with { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries, including { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. The ban was eventually blocked by { US } [ United States ] judges, and when the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] Prime Minister { Haider al-Abadi } [ Haider al-Abadi ] spoke to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] over the phone on 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of { Mosul } [ Mosul ] from { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the { US } [ United States ] a few weeks later for a meeting at the { White House } [ White House ], when { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told reporters: \"Our main thrust is we have to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. We're going to get rid of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] It will happen. It's happening right now. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] congratulated his { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] counterpart, saying { Mosul } [ Mosul ] had been \"liberated from its long nightmare\" under the rule of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ].Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said he was \"cancelling\" President { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] deal to thaw relations with { Cuba } [ Cuba ], saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor {. } [ Barack Obama ] But the { president } [ President of the United States ]'s approach has not scrapped all of the { Obama-era } [ Presidency of Barack Obama ] policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their { embassies } [ Diplomatic mission ] open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and { US } [ United States ] tourists can still return home with { Cuban } [ Cuba ] goods. During a speech in { Miami } [ Miami ]'s { Little Havana } [ Little Havana ] neighbourhood, where Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the \"brutal\" { Castro } [ Fidel Castro ] government as \"terrible\" and \"misguided\".He said the { US } [ United States ] would not lift sanctions on { Cuba } [ Cuba ] until \"all political prisoners are freed\" and vowed to \"help the { Cuban } [ Cuba ] people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives\".President Trump met { Italy } [ Italy ]'s { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Italy ] { Paolo Gentiloni } [ Paolo Gentiloni ] three times since taking office. He first welcomed the { Italian } [ Italy ] prime minister to the { White House } [ White House ] in April and less than a month later met him twice more before the { G-7 } [ Group of Seven ] in { Italy } [ Italy ]. President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also called Mr { Gentiloni } [ Enzo Gentiloni ] in July ahead of the { Group of 20 } [ Group of 20 ] ( {G20 } [ Group of 20 ]) meeting, in which he thanked the { Italian } [ Italy ] PM for hosting the \"exception { G7 } [ Group of Seven ] summit in May\".Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is one of many foreign leaders to have held one phone conversation with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. The call with the { Qatari } [ Qatar ] emir came in early February amid an attempted travel ban by Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] that affected several { Middle Eastern } [ Middle East ] countries, but not { Qatar } [ Qatar ] itself. The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group, with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. Earlier this year, several { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] countries cut travel and embassy links with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical { Islamism } [ Islamism ] {. } [ Islamism ]Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] took initial credit for applying pressure on { Qatar } [ Qatar ] in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark \"the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism\". In early June, he again accused { Qatar } [ Qatar ] of funding terrorism, tweeting:\"During my recent trip to the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to { Qatar } [ Qatar ] \u2013 look!\"But { Washington } [ United States ] would stand to benefit most from a resolution with { Qatar } [ Qatar ] as the US ally is home to the largest { American } [ United States ] military facility in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] met Prime Minister { Narendra Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] for the first time in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] { DC } [ Washington, D.C. ], in late June. The two leaders, who shared a warm embrace in front of reporters, vowed to fight { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] together, praised { US-India relations } [ India\u2013United States relations ] and issued a warning to { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. \"The relationship between { India } [ India ] and the { United States } [ United States ] has never been stronger, never been better,\" said Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], who describes himself and Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] as \"world leaders in social media\".Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] was also the first foreign dignitary to dine with Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] at the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] Prior to the meeting {, } [ Donald Trump ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] spoke by phone with Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] twice. The first call happened just a couple of days after Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] { inauguration } [ Inauguration of Donald Trump ] {. } [ Donald Trump ] The pair agreed they must stand \"shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism\" and { President } [ President of India ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] invited Mr { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] to the { White House } [ White House ] later in 2017. The { US } [ United States ] president also rang { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of India ] { Modi } [ Narendra Modi ] at the end of March to congratulate him on his party's good showing in state-level elections in { India } [ India ].President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] caused a bit of a stir about { Sweden } [ Sweden ] during one of his regular attacks on the { media } [ News media ] at a rally in February. \"Look at what's happening last night in { Sweden } [ Sweden ] {. } [ Sweden ] { Sweden } [ Sweden ], who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers of { migrants } [ Immigration ]. { They } [ American Airlines ]'re having problems like { they } [ American Airlines ] never thought possible,\" the new { US } [ United States ] president told the crowd in { Florida } [ Florida ] {. } [ United States ]The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] was referring to - not least lots of baffled { Swedes } [ Sweden ]. It later emerged that Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] had been referring to a report on { Fox News } [ Fox News ] about gun violence and rape in { Sweden } [ Sweden ] since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013. But { police officers } [ Police officer ] interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context and data didn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or { rape } [ Rape ]. Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister { Stefan Lofven } [ Stefan Lofven ] during this saga, he did phone the { Swedish } [ Sweden ] leader in April to express condolences over an attack in { Stockholm } [ Stockholm ] {. } [ Stockholm ]Donald Trump said he had \"very, very good discussions\" with { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] {'s } [ Ukraine ] President { Petro Poroshenko } [ Petro Poroshenko ] during the foreign leader {'s } [ Ukraine ] { White House } [ White House ] visit in late June.Later in July, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] called on { Russia } [ Russia ] to stop \"destabilising\" { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and \"join the community of responsible nations\". The { Kremlin } [ Moscow Kremlin ] brushed off the comments. Mr Trump has previously accused { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] of having been weak on { Russia } [ Russia ] and allowing them to \"pick off\" the { Crimean } [ Crimea ] peninsula from { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ]. The { US } [ United States ] president's calls for better ties to { Russia } [ Russia ] have worried { Ukrainian } [ Ukraine ] authorities, observers say. But Mr Trump announced sanctions against { Russia } [ Russia ] for its role in the conflicts in { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] would remain even after his meeting with President { Vladimir Putin } [ Vladimir Putin ] at the { G20 } [ G20 ] summit in { Hamburg } [ Hamburg ]. The { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of Pakistan ] got some signs that { President } [ President of Pakistan ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] would be open to negotiating a trade deal with the UK after it leaves the { European Union } [ European Union ], though there was no firm guarantee.  \"Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in { commerce } [ Commerce ] {, } [ Commerce ] business { and } [ Business ] foreign affairs,\" he said at their joint press conference {. } [ Commerce ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] accepted the invitation Mrs { May } [ May government ] extended from the { Queen } [ Elizabeth II ] for a { state visit } [ State visit ], but the prospect stirred controversy back in the UK. Nearly two million people signed one of a number of { petitions } [ Petition ] calling to withdraw Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] invite {. } [ Donald Trump ] The { US } [ United States ] president reportedly changed his mind and is now expected to travel to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] in 2018, the { BBC } [ BBC ] understands.He came under criticism for attacking { London } [ London ] Mayor { Sadiq Khan } [ Sadiq Khan ] over his response to recent terror attacks.Yemen was the site of the first military operation authorised by { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], in which a { special forces } [ Special forces ] team raided the compound of a suspected { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The { US Navy } [ United States Navy ] { Seals } [ United States Navy Seals ] came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group ( {AQAP } [ Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ]) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emerged that a number of { civilians } [ Civilian ] were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ]. In an interview with { Fox News } [ Fox News ], { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William \"Ryan\" Owens on military leaders. \"This was a mission that was started before I got here,\" { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said. \"They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. And they lost { Ryan } [ Ryanathons ] {. } [ Ryanathons ]\"A { New York Times } [ The New York Times ] article claimed the { Navy Seals } [ United States Navy Seals ] found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting { AQAP } [ American AQAP ] communications but they \"pressed on toward their target\" nonetheless. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] responded to criticism by { tweeting } [ Twitter ] that it had been \"a winning mission. { not } [ Not (newspaper) ] a { failure } [ Failure ] {\". } [ Not (newspaper) ] She got a { standing ovation } [ Standing ovation ] and as the room applauded, the { president } [ President of the United States ] said her { husband } [ Husband ]'s \"legacy is etched into eternity\".Apart from that mission, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s only other mentions of { Yemen } [ Yemen ] have been regarding his ban on its citizens from travelling to { America } [ United States ].The { US Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] ruled to partly allow Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] ban to go into effect until the justices take up the matter in October. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has described the six { Muslim-majority } [ Muslim world ] nations included in the ban as \"terror-prone countries\".President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has yet to formally meet with or call the { Georgian } [ Georgia (country) ] Prime Minister { Giorgi Kvirikashvili } [ Giorgi Kvirikashvili ], though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] and met with Vice President { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ]. During his { White House } [ White House ] visit, the { Trump Administration } [ Presidency of Donald Trump ] thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for { Georgia } [ Georgia (country) ]'s sacrifices fighting with { NATO } [ NATO ] forces in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries.Libya's leaders are yet to talk to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ], but their country was one of six predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] states that he has tried - and failed - to ban people coming to the { US } [ United States ] from. The country has been beset by chaos since { Nato } [ NATO ]-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col { Muammar Gaddafi } [ Muammar Gaddafi ] in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group ( {IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years but { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is yet to articulate what his policy is on the country.While { President } [ President of the United States ] Trump has not spoken to { Somali } [ Somalia ] { President } [ President of the United States ] { Hassan Sheikh Mohamud } [ Hassan Sheikh Mohamud ], he has tried to ban { Somalis } [ Somalia ] from entering the US. The proposed ban has been partly reinstated by the { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from { Iran } [ Iran ], { Libya } [ Libya ], { Somalia } [ Somalia ], { Sudan } [ Sudan ], { Syria } [ Syria ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ] for 90 days. { He } [ George W. Bush ] has described the affected nations as \"terror-prone countries\".In May, a member of the { US } [ United States ] military was killed in { Somalia } [ Somalia ], the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous { Black Hawk Down } [ Black Hawk Down ( incident) ] incident. The { US } [ United States ] announced in April that it is sending dozens of troops to { Somalia } [ Somalia ] to train forces fighting { Islamist } [ Islam ] group { al-Shabab } [ Al-Shabab (militant group) ].It is the first time regular { US } [ United States ] troops have been deployed in { Somalia } [ Somalia ] since 1994, although some { counter-terrorism } [ Counter-terrorism ] advisers are already there. In 1993, 18 { US } [ United States ] { special forces } [ Special forces ] personnel were killed in the incident dramatised in the { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ] film { Black Hawk Down } [ Black Hawk Down (film) ].The { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on { Mexico } [ Mexico ] and the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], but they could also affect thousands of unregistered { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] immigrants in the US.Former { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] Prime Minister { Enda Kenny } [ Enda Kenny ] raised this issue with President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] when he visited the { White House } [ White House ] in March, saying there were \"millions out there who want to. make { America } [ United States ] great.\"The { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] traditionally presents the new { US } [ United States ] president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr { Kenny } [ Kenny (title) ] did so while making his views on President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s immigration policies clear. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: \"We love { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] and we love the people of { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {. } [ United States ]\"The president has business interests in { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in the form of a { golf course } [ Golf course ] and resort in { Doonbeg } [ Doonbeg ], { County Clare } [ County Clare ]. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has yet to meet the newest { Taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] { Leo Varadkar } [ Leo Varadkar ], but the two spoke by phone for about 15 minutes following the young { prime minister } [ Prime minister ]'s confirmation. Mr { Varadkar } [ Varadkar ] was confirmed as { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {'s } [ Republic of Ireland ] youngest and first openly { gay } [ Gay ] leader in June. \"We have so many people from { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] in this country - I know so many of them, I feel I know all of them,\" said Mr Trump, who invited the { taoiseach } [ Taoiseach ] to the { St Patrick's Day } [ Saint Patrick's Day ] celebration in March.Sudan is another of the predominantly { Muslim } [ Islam ] countries that { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has included on his { travel ban list } [ Donald Trump travel ban ].

The { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians.It was 10 June 2014, and { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant ( {Isis } [ Islamic State of Iraq ] or { Isil } [ Islamic State of Iraq ]).Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern { Syria } [ Syria ] and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize.Rich dividends were immediate. The { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the { Americans } [ United States ] since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the { Central Bank } [ Central Bank of Iraq ]'s { Mosul } [ Mosul ] branch.Despite territorial losses {, } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] IS survives {, } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] thanks in no small part to its status as \"the best-funded { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] organisation\" in history {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]Islamic State: The struggle to stay rich\"At the beginning, they behaved well,\" said Abu Anis. \"They took down all the barricades the { army } [ Army ] had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their { checkpoints } [ Security checkpoint ] they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'\"The { Mosul } [ Mosul ] { honeymoon } [ Honeymoon ] was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.As the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the { Tigris } [ Tigris ] river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of { Baiji } [ Baiji, Iraq ] and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ]'s old hometown, { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ], a { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] hotbed.Just outside { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ] is a big military base, taken over by the { Americans } [ United States ] in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 \"Desert Storm\" { Gulf } [ Gulf War ] war against { Iraq } [ Iraq ], a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over { al-Anbar } [ Al Anbar Governorate ] province in the west.Camp Speicher, by now full of { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] military recruits, was surrounded by the { Isis } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The { mass graves } [ Mass grave ] are still being { exhumed } [ Burial ] {. } [ Exhumation ]Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, { Isis } [ Isis ] revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.After a pause of just two months, { Isis } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] - now rebranded as \" {Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]\" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern { Iraq } [ Iraq ] controlled by the { Kurds } [ Kurdistan ].That included the town of { Sinjar } [ Sinjar ], mainly populated by the { Yazidis } [ Yazidis ], an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as { heretics } [ Heresy ].Hundreds of { Yazidi } [ Yazidis ] men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as { chattels } [ Personal property ], and used as { sex slaves } [ Sexual slavery ]. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty { exhibitionism } [ Exhibitionism ] reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014.In the following weeks, more { American } [ United States ] and { British } [ United Kingdom ] journalists and aid workers - { Steven Sotloff } [ Steven Sotloff ], David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to { Islam } [ Islam ] and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.In the space of a few months, { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight {, } [ List of Latin phrases (L) ] it became a household word.Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then { Australian } [ Australia ] { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Australia ] { Tony Abbott } [ Tony Abbott ] summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror.IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in { black } [ Black ] did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.The theology of murderThe ideological or religious roots of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of { Islam } [ Islam ] itself in the 7th Century AD.Like { Christianity } [ Christianity ] six centuries before it, and { Judaism } [ Judaism ] some eight centuries before that, { Islam } [ Islam ] was born into the harsh, tribal world of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ].\"The original texts, the { Old Testament } [ Old Testament ] and the { Koran } [ Quran ], reflected primitive tribal { Jewish } [ Jews ] and { Arab } [ Arabs ] societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,\" writes the historian and author { William Polk } [ William Polk ].\"They aimed, in the { Old Testament } [ Old Testament ], at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the { Koran } [ Quran ], at destroying the vestiges of { pagan } [ Paganism ] belief and practice.

Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of { power } [ Power (social and political) ] and { politics } [ Politics ] and temporal rulers.For hardline { Muslim } [ Islam ] traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the \"purity\" of the early days of { Islam } [ Islam ] often paid a price.The eminent scholar { Ahmad ibn Hanbal } [ Ahmad ibn Hanbal ] (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] { Islamic } [ Islam ] jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the { Abbasid } [ Abbasid Caliphate ] caliph in { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ].They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the { salafist } [ Salafi movement ] movement, one form of which, { Wahhabism } [ Wahhabism ], took his name.Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the { Nejd } [ Najd ] region in the middle of the { Arabian } [ Arabian Peninsula ] peninsula.A devout { Islamic } [ Islam ] scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power.In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of { Zayd ibn al-Khattab } [ Zayd ibn al-Khattab ], one of the { Companions } [ Companions of the Prophet ] of the Prophet { Muhammad } [ Muhammad ], on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than { Allah } [ Allah ].But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, { Muhammad ibn Saud } [ Muhammad ibn Saud ]. It was a pact whereby { Wahhabism } [ Wahhabism ] provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] political and military expansion, to the benefit of both.Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the { House of Saud } [ House of Saud ] ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative { Wahhabi } [ Wahhabism ] religious establishment.The entrenchment of { Wahhabi } [ Wahhabism ] salafism in { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] militancy in the region in modern times.   { Jihad } [ Jihad ]  means struggle on the path of { Allah } [ Allah ], which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of { Abd al-Wahhab } [ Abd al-Wahhab ] and his predecessors to a new generation of { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] militants, leading up to { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and all that was to follow.Born in a small village in { Upper Egypt } [ Upper Egypt ] in 1906, { Sayyid } [ Sayyid ] Qutb found himself at odds with the way { Islam } [ Islam ] was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the { West } [ Western world ], a two-year study period in the { US } [ United States ] in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his { fundamentalist } [ Fundamentalism ] { Islamic } [ Islam ] outlook was honed harder.Back in { Egypt } [ Egypt ], he developed the view that the { West } [ Western world ] was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the { Ottoman Empire } [ Ottoman Empire ]'s collapse after { World War One } [ World War I ], with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be { Muslims } [ Islam ], but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.For Qutb, offensive { jihad } [ Jihad ] against both the { West } [ Western world ] and its local agents was the only way for the { Muslim } [ Islam ] world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another { Muslim } [ Muslims ] an { apostate } [ Apostasy ] or { kafir } [ Kafir ] (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active { jihadist } [ Jihad ], { Qutb } [ Nasrallah Boutes Qutb ] was judged dangerously subversive by the { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] plot to assassinate the { nationalist } [ Nationalism ] President, { Gamal Abdel Nasser } [ Gamal Abdel Nasser ] {. } [ Gamal Abdel Nasser ]Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like { Ayman al-Zawahiri } [ Ayman al-Zawahiri ], another { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] who is the current { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] leader.Another intimate of the { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] founder { Osama Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] said: \" {Qutb } [ Qutb ] was the one who most affected our generation.\" He has also been described as \"the source of all { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] thought\", and \"the { philosopher } [ Philosopher ] of the { Islamic } [ Islam ] revolution\".More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] attack on the { Twin Towers } [ World Trade Center (1973\u20132001) ] in 2001 concluded: \" {Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] shares { Qutb } [ Nasser Qutb ]'s stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith.\"And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] expert on { Islamist } [ Islam ] movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: \"They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of { Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab } [ Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab ], and as methodology, the way of { Sayyid Qutb } [ Sayyid Qutb ].\"The { theology } [ Theology ] of militant { jihadism } [ Jihadism ] was in place.Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.Rise of { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]The { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly { Islamist } [ Islam ] Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into { Russia } [ Russia ]'s { Vietnam } [ Vietnam ].There is little evidence that the \"Afghan Arabs\", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the { Soviets } [ Soviet Union ] out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], channelling funds from { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for { networking } [ Business networking ] and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting { jihad } [ Jihad ] first hand.Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the { Americans } [ United States ]. The { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ]'s { Operation Cyclone } [ Operation Cyclone ] channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] to militant { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] mujahedeen leaders such as { Golbuddin Hekmatyar } [ Golbuddin Hekmatyar ], who associated closely with the { Arab } [ Arab world ] jihadists.It was in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] that virtually all the major figures in the new { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] as a vehicle for a wider global { jihad } [ Jihad ], and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] provided a base for it.By the time the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with { Osama Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] and his men, and it was from there that { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] launched its fateful { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] attack in 2001.The formative { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] of today.A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a { mosque } [ Mosque ] in the { Jordanian } [ Jordan ] capital, { Amman } [ Amman ] {. } [ Amman ] He arrived in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] to join { jihad } [ Jihad ] in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] just in time to see the { Soviets } [ Soviet Union ] withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.After a stint back in { Jordan } [ Jordan ] where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, { Zarqawi } [awi (film) ] finally met { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] and { Ayman al-Zawahiri } [ Ayman al-Zawahiri ] in 1999. By all accounts the two { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many { tattoos } [ Tattoo ] from his previous life that he had not been able to erase. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent { salafist } [ Salafi movement ] blood-letting: { Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir } [ Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir ] {. } [ Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir ] His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] as infidels, and their { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] collaborators as apostates.The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the { Mein Kampf } [ Mein Kampf ] - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by { Abu Bakr Naji } [ Abu Bakr Naji ], which appeared on the internet in 2004.\"We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to { Banu Qurayza } [ Banu Qurayza ], so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,\" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a { Jewish } [ Jews ] tribe in seventh-century { Arabia } [ Arabian Peninsula ] which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early { Muslims } [ Islam ] as the { Yazidis } [ Yazidis ] of { Sinjar } [ Sinjar ] did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an { Islamic } [ Islam ] { caliphate } [ Caliphate ] {. } [ Caliphate ] Based partly on the lessons of { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the { West } [ Western world ] into interventions which would further rally the { Muslims } [ Islam ] to { jihad } [ Jihad ], leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ] went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] {. } [ Afghanistan ]Naji is reported to have been killed in a { US } [ United States ] drone strike in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]'s { Waziristan } [ Waziristan ] province in 2008.Iraq fiascoThe fallout from the { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] attacks changed things radically for the { jihadists } [ Jihadism ] in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], ousting the { Taliban } [ Taliban ], and launching a wider \" {War on Terror } [ War on Terror ] {\" } [ War on Terror ] against { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ].Bin Laden went underground, and { Zarqawi } [ Abdul Qadeer Zarqawi ] and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their { Western } [ Western world ] enemies.Luck was on their side. The { Americans } [ United States ] and their allies were not long in providing it.Their invasion of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] {'s } [ Saddam Hussein ] alleged production of { weapons of mass destruction } [ Weapon of mass destruction ], and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of \"savagery\", or violent chaos, that { Abu Bakr Naji } [ Abu Bakr Naji ] envisaged for the { jihadists } [ Jihadism ] to thrive in.Iraq was on the way to becoming what { US } [ United States ] officials are now calling the \"parent tumour\" of the { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] presence in the region.Under Saddam's tightly-controlled { Baath Party } [ Ba'ath Party ] regime, the { Sunnis } [ Sunni Islam ] enjoyed pride of place over the majority { Shia } [ Shia Islam ], who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in { Iran } [ Iran ].The { US-led intervention } [ United States intervention in Iraq ] disempowered the { Sunnis } [ Islam ], creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside { salafist } [ Salafi movement ] jihadists to take root in.They were not long in spotting their { constituency } [ Electoral district ]. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at { Western } [ Western world ] targets and at the majority { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] community.Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet { Muhammad } [ Muhammad ] in the early decades of { Islam } [ Islam ], but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.Setting himself up with a new group called { Tawhid wa al-Jihad } [ Tawhid wa al-Jihad ] ( {Tawhid } [ Tawhid ] means declaring the uniqueness of { Allah } [ Allah ]), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant { Jihadism } [ Jihadism ], and Iraqi Sunni nationalism.His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] that killed the envoy { Sergio Vieira de Mello } [ Sergio Vieira de Mello ] and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in { Najaf } [ Najaf ] which killed the influential { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] ayatollah { Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim } [ Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim ] and 80 of his followers. The bombers were { salafist } [ Salafi movement ] { jihadists } [ Jihadism ], but logistics were reportedly provided by underground { Baathists } [ Ba'ath Party ] {. } [ Ba'ath Party ]The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an { American } [ United States ] hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the { Abu Ghraib } [ Abu Ghraib ] prison abuses of { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] detainees by members of the US military.As the battle with the { Americans } [ United States ] and the new Shia-dominated { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] government intensified, { Zarqawi } [awi ] finally took the oath of loyalty to { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ], and his group became the official { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] branch in { Iraq } [ Iraq ].But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] leadership, concerned at the impact on { Muslim } [ Islam ] opinion.Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a { US } [ United States ] air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] {. } [ Baghdad ] He was easily identified by the { tattoos } [ Tattoo ] he had never managed to get rid of.The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] branch together with other insurgent factions.But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the { Americans } [ United States ] began \"surging\" their own troops in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army. At the same time, they enticed { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] tribes in western { al-Anbar } [ Al Anbar Governorate ] province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.By the time both the new ISI and { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] { Iraq } [ Iraq ].They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his { nom de guerre } [ Pseudonym ], { Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ] {. } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ]Territorial takeoverBaghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near { Samarra } [ Samarra ], north of { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ], so the epithet \"Baghdadi\" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while \" {Abu Bakr } [ Abu Bakr ]\" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet { Muhammad } [ Muhammad ].Like the original { Abu Bakr } [ Abu Bakr ], { Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr ] is also reputed to come from the { Prophet } [ Muhammad ]'s { Quraysh } [ Quraysh ] clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of { Islam } [ Islam ], taking a { doctorate } [ Doctorate ] at the { Islamic University } [ Islamic university ] of { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ].The word \"charismatic\" has never been attached to him.As a youth, { Baghdadi } [ Baghdadi family ] had a passion for { Koranic } [ Quran ] recitation and was meticulous in his observance of { religious law } [ Religious law ] {. } [ Law ] His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards.Who is { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] leader { Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ]?But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] group, heading its { Sharia } [ Sharia ] (Islamic law) committee. { American } [ United States ] troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at { Camp Bucca } [ Camp Bucca ] in the south for most of 2004.Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical { ideologies } [ Ideology ] and { sabotage } [ Sabotage ] skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.Baghdadi would also certainly have met in { Camp Bucca } [ Camp Bucca ] many of the ex- {Baathist } [ Ba'ath Party ] military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.The low-profile, self-effacing { Baghdadi } [ Baghdadi ] rang no alarm bells with the { Americans } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] They released him, having decided he was low-risk.But he went on to work his way steadily up through the { insurgent } [ Iraqi insurgency (2003\u20132011) ] hierarchy, virtually unknown to the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] public.By the time { Baghdadi } [ Nasser al-Baghdadi ] took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the { jihadists } [ Jihadism ] in the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] field of \"savagery\".But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring { Syria } [ Syria ] at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of { civil war } [ Civil war ] there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority { Sunnis } [ Sunni Islam ] were in revolt against the oppressive regime of { Bashar al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ], dominated by his { Alawite } [ Alawites ] minority, an offshoot of { Shia Islam } [ Shia Islam ].Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly { car bombs } [ Car bomb ] were exploding in { Damascus } [ Damascus ] which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy { al-Nusra Front } [ Al-Nusra Front ] {. } [ Al-Nusra Front ] It announced itself as an { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] affiliate the following month. It was headed by a { Syrian } [ Syria ] { jihadist } [ Jihadism ], Abu Mohammed al-Julani. He had been sent by { Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ], but had his own ideas.Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in { Syria } [ Syria ], { al-Nusra } [ Al-Nusra Front ] won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its { salafist } [ Salafi movement ] approach, and cultivated local relationships. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that { al-Nusra } [ Al-Nusra Front ] was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham ( {Syria } [ Syria ] or the { Levant } [ Levant ]). Isis, or { Isil } [ Isil ] {, } [ Isil ] was born.During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it.But { Julani } [ Ajay Julani ] rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s global leadership, now under { Ayman al-Zawahiri } [ Ayman al-Zawahiri ] following { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {'s death } [ Death of Osama bin Laden ] in 2011. Zawahiri ordered { Baghdadi } [ Abdelkader Baghdadi ] to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave { al-Nusra } [ Al-Nusra Front ] as the { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] Syria franchise.It was { Baghdadi } [ Nasser Baghdadi ] {'s } [ Saddam Hussein ] turn to ignore orders from { head office } [ Head of government ] {. } [ Saddam Hussein ]Before 2013 was out, { Isis } [ Isis ] and { al-Nusra } [ Al-Nusra Front ] were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with { Isis } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] being driven out of most of north-west { Syria } [ Syria ] by al-Nusra and allied { Syrian } [ Syria ] rebel factions. But { Isis } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] took over { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ], a provincial { capital } [ Capital city ] in the north-east, and made it its { capital } [ Capital city ]. In early 2014, { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] formally disowned { Isis } [ Isis ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next?Fortune smiled once more. { Back } [ Iran ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {, } [ Syria ] conditions had again become ripe for the { jihadists } [ Jihadism ] {. } [ Syria ] The { Americans } [ United States ] had gone, since the end of { 2011 } [ 2011 in sports ] {. } [ 2011 in sports ] { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] Prime Minister, { Nouri Maliki } [ Nouri Maliki ] {. } [ Nouri Maliki ] Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.When { Isis } [ Isis ] decided to move {, } [ Isis ] it was pushing at an open door {. } [ Isis ] In fact, it had never really left { Iraq } [ Iraq ], just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex- {Saddamist } [ Al-Qaeda ] militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.With the capture of { Mosul } [ Mosul ], { Isis } [ Isis ] morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] army not only threatening the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] state, but challenging the entire world. A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka { Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ], made a surprise appearance in { Mosul } [ Mosul ] in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of Nour al-Din al-Zangi, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's { Muslims } [ Islam ] to rally behind him.By declaring a { caliphate } [ Caliphate ] and adopting the generic \" {Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {\" } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond { Syria } [ Syria ] and { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. It was going { global } [ World ] {. } [ World ] While it remains the ideal, { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] and other { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now { Baghdadi } [ Abdelkader Baghdadi ] was trumping the parent organisation, setting { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global { jihadism } [ Jihadism ] {. } [ Jihad ]A { caliphate } [ Caliphate ] (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a { caliph } [ Caliphate ] (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the { Prophet } [ Prophet ] { Muhammad } [ Muhammad ]. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the { Islamic Caliphate } [ Caliphate ] burst out of { Arabia } [ Arabian Peninsula ] and extended through modern-day { Iran } [ Iran ] to the east, into { Libya } [ Libya ] to the west, and to the { Caucasus } [ Caucasus ] in the north.The { Umayyad } [ Umayyad Caliphate ] caliphate which followed, based in { Damascus } [ Damascus ], took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including { Spain } [ Spain ] {. } [ Spain ] The Baghdad-based { Abbasid } [ Abbasid Caliphate ] caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] was sacked by the { Mongols } [ Mongol Empire ] in 1258.Emerging from that, the { Ottoman Empire } [ Ottoman Empire ], based in { Constantinople } [ Constantinople ] ( {Istanbul } [ Istanbul ]), stretched almost to { Vienna } [ Vienna ] at its peak, and was also a { caliphate } [ Caliphate ], though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The { caliphate } [ Caliphate ] was finally abolished by { Ataturk } [ Atat\u00fcrk ] in 1924. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the { Prophet } [ Prophet ], and of his followers who carried { Islam } [ Islam ] into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.For most { Islamic } [ Islam ] scholars and authorities, not to mention { Arab } [ Arab world ] and { Muslim } [ Islam ] leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new { caliphate } [ Caliphate ]. But the { millennial } [ Millennials ] echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some { Islamic } [ Islam ] romantics - and with some like-minded { radical } [ Political radicalism ] groups abroad.Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in { Libya } [ Libya ] became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the { Ansar Beit al-Maqdis } [ Ansar Beit al-Maqdis ] jihadist faction in { Egypt } [ Egypt ]'s { Sinai } [ Sinai Peninsula ]. IS's tentacles spread deeper into { Africa } [ Africa ] in March 2015 when { Boko Haram } [ Boko Haram ] in { Nigeria } [ Nigeria ] took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq ]It was in those two core countries that { Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ] and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of { Islamic } [ Islam ] rule.To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient { cultural } [ Cultural heritage ] and { archaeological } [ Archaeology ] heritage sites and artefacts.Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of { Bel } [ Bel (mythology) ] and { Baalshamin } [ Baalshamin ] at { Palmyra } [ Palmyra ] in { Syria } [ Syria ], and the { Assyrian } [ Assyrian people ] cities of { Hatra } [ Hatra ] and { Nimrud } [ Nimrud ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ].It wasn't just famous { archaeological } [ Archaeology ] sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] mosques. Barely a month after taking over { Mosul } [ Mosul ], IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the { Mongol } [ Mongols ] invasion.All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of { Islam } [ Islam ], under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than { Allah } [ Allah ], and any non- {Muslim } [ Islam ] structures are monuments of idolatry. Even { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of { beheading } [ Decapitation ] aid workers.And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on { cultural heritage } [ Cultural heritage ] {. } [ Cultural heritage ] In highly organised manner, IS's { Treasury Department } [ Treasury Department (IS) ] issues printed permits to loot { archaeological } [ Archaeology ] sites, and takes a percentage of the proceeds.That is just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ]'s intelligence apparatus had done.Captured documents published by { Der Spiegel } [ Der Spiegel ] last year give some idea of the role of ex- {Baathist } [ Ba'ath Party ] regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] and { security } [ Security ].Residents of { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] strongholds like { Mosul } [ Mosul ] and { Falluja } [ Fallujah ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ], and { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ] in { Syria } [ Syria ], found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against { databases } [ Database ] on { laptops } [ Laptop ], obtained from government { ration } [ Rationing ] or employee registers.\"At first, all they did was change the preachers in the { mosques } [ Mosque ] to people with their own views,\" said a { Mosul } [ Mosul ] resident who fled a year later.\"But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the { headscarf } [ Headscarf ] and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow { beards } [ Beard ] and wear short-legged { trousers } [ Trousers ] {. } [ Trousers ] Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police hisba vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.\"A { Falluja } [ Falluja ] resident recounted the story of a taxi-driver who had picked up a middle-aged woman not wearing a headscarf. They were stopped at an { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an { Islamic } [ Islam ] court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the { Koran } [ Quran ] {. } [ Quran ] If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.\"They have courts with { judges } [ Judge ], { officials } [ Official ], records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each { crime } [ Crime ], it's not random,\" said the { Falluja } [ Falluja ] resident. \"Adulterers are { stoned } [ Stoning ] to { death } [ Death ] {. } [ Death ] Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia prisoners are beheaded.\"An activist based in { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ] from a group called Al-Sharqiya 24 has been keeping a diary of what life is like under { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] group rule.Life under ' {Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]': DiariesThere are { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] departments that carry the organisation's grip into every corner of life, including { finance } [ Finance ], { agriculture } [ Agriculture ], { education } [ Education ], { transport } [ Transport ], { health } [ Health ], { welfare } [ Welfare ] and { utilities } [ Public utility ].School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and { English } [ English language ] taken off the menu.\"One thing you can say is this,\" said the { Mosul } [ Mosul ] resident. \"There is absolutely no { corruption } [ Corruption ], no { wasta } [ Warta ] (knowing the right people and pulling strings). They are totally convinced they are on the right track.\"One recent story tells a lot about { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and its ways.As { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] security forces were pressing forward in areas around { Ramadi } [ Ramadi ] earlier this year, civilians were fleeing the battle - and { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too.Two { women } [ Woman ], running from the combat zone, approached a { police } [ Police ] checkpoint. He's an { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] { emir } [ Emir ] commander.\"The { police } [ Police ] investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on { makeup } [ Cosmetics ] and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] commanders.\"When { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] arrived, he killed my husband, who was a { policeman } [ Police officer ], { raped } [ Rape ] me, and then took me as his wife,\" the woman told the { police } [ Police ].\"I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,\" she said.This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who are still inside the { IS-held } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] city.Taking on the worldHaving taken over vast swathes of territory in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ], prompting the { Americans } [ United States ] to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army.Just two months later, the attack on { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the { Kurdistan } [ Kurdistan ] capital, { Irbil } [ Erbil ], and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the { Yazidis } [ Yazidis ]. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign.Ten days later, IS beheaded { James Foley } [ James Foley (journalist) ] and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as { punishment } [ Punishment ], { deterrent } [ Deterrence (psychology) ] and { provocation } [ Provocation (legal) ]. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed { Jordanian } [ Jordan ] pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.The US-led bombing campaign was extended to { Syria } [ Syria ] in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of { Kobane } [ Koban\u00ee ] on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at { Kobane } [ Koban\u00ee ] and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad.From the declaration of the { caliphate } [ Caliphate ] until early 2016, some 90 terrorist attacks were either carried out or inspired by IS in 21 countries around the globe, from { California } [ California ] to { Sydney } [ Sydney ], with an estimated 1,400 victims killed. The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {'s } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] global reach.At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {, } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] \"the enemy\" is { everybody } [ World ] who does not embrace it {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of { Islam } [ Islam ], and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a { Russian } [ Russia ] airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the { Paris attacks } [ November 2015 Paris attacks ] on 13 November, provoking both { Russia } [ Russia ] and { France } [ France ] to intensify air strikes on IS targets in { Syria } [ Syria ].Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the { Americans } [ United States ], the { Russians } [ Russia ], and a long list of others. { By its own count } [ List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel ] {, } [ List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel ] it had a mere 40,000 { fighters } [ Fighter aircraft ] at its command (other estimates go as low as half that).When the organisation first brought out its { online magazine } [ Online magazine ] - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the \" {caliphate } [ Caliphate ] {\" } [ Caliphate ] was declared, it was not by chance that it was named { Dabiq } [ Dabiq (magazine) ].A small town north of { Aleppo } [ Aleppo ] in { Syria } [ Syria ], Dabiq is mentioned in a { hadith } [ Hadith ] (a reported saying of the Prophet { Muhammad } [ Muhammad ]) in connection with { Armageddon } [ Armageddon ]. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the { Muslims } [ Islam ] and the infidels, leading to the { end of days } [ End time ]. Each issue of { Dabiq } [ Dabiq (newspaper) ] begins with a quote from { Abu Musab Zarqawi } [ Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ]: \"The spark has been lit here in { Iraq } [ Iraq ], and its heat will continue to intensify - by { Allah } [ Allah ]'s permission - until it burns the crusader armies in { Dabiq } [ Dabiq (newspaper) ].\"The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of { Allah } [ Allah ] and an assured place in { paradise } [ Paradise ], is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] call to { jihad } [ Jihad ]. Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.It's one of the elements that makes { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] a formidable fighting force that will be hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.IS is in many respects a project of former { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] President { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ]'s outlawed { Baath } [ Ba'ath Party ] party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] {'s } [ Saddam Hussein ] regime dominate its leadership. They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through { US } [ United States ] occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated.Is { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] invincible?The head of security and intelligence for the { Kurdistan Regional Government } [ Kurdistan Regional Government ] (KRG) in northern { Iraq } [ Iraq ], Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: \"I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet { Muhammad } [ Muhammad ]!\"\"They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,\" says { Barzani } [ Masrour Barzani ]. \"If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed {, } [ Christian theology ] they go { to } [ Christian theology ] { heaven } [ Heaven ] {. } [ Christian theology ] With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them.\"Probably for the first time in military history since the { Japanese } [ Japan ] { kamikaze } [ Kamikaze ] squadrons of { World War Two } [ World War II ], { suicide bombers } [ Suicide attack ] are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic.Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several { suicide bombers } [ Suicide attack ] driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the \"martyrdom-seekers\" have been called the organisation's \"air force\", since they serve a similar purpose.Formidable though that is, { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up.\"The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] officers, particularly from the { Republican Guard } [ Republican Guard (Iran) ] {,\" } [ Republican Guard (Iran) ] said an international { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] official. \"They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army are. That's the hand of former { military } [ Military ] staff { officers } [ Officer (armed forces) ] who know their { business } [ Business ]. \"They use { artillery } [ Artillery ], { armoured vehicles } [ Vehicle armour ], heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have { officers } [ Officer (armed forces) ] who know conventional { war } [ War ] and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] organisation.\"The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to { Zarqawi } [ Abdul Qadir Zarqawi ]'s early days in { Iraq } [ Iraq ], is clearly a vital component in { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] success.But that does not mean its fighters are invincible on the battlefield. The { Kurds } [ Kurds ] in north-east { Syria } [ Syria ] were fighting { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, { IS } [ IS (motorcycle) ] makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.In December 2015, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of { Mosul } [ Mosul ] alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month.  In total some 15,000 are estimated to have been killed by { Coalition } [ Coalition of the Gulf War ] air strikes since August 2014.But they seem to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent { Sunnis } [ Islam ] to draw on in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ], most recruiting is done locally. And if { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] remains in place {, } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] there will soon be a new generation of young militants.\"I didn't join out of conviction,\" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] quarter in southern { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] areas, which he admits. He was detained for questioning by { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to { Mosul } [ Mosul ], where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ], and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets. \"I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an { Iraqi } [ Iraq ]. He believed he would go to { paradise } [ Paradise ] when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to { Heaven } [ Heaven ] {. } [ Heaven ] They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to { Heaven } [ Heaven ]. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s.\"\"I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing { women } [ Woman ] and { children } [ Child ], I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family.\" {Bakr } [ Alexander Bakr ] knows he will almost certainly hang. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.\"Absolutely not. I would get out of { Iraq } [ Iraq ], away from { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ], away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now.\"But up in { Kurdistan } [ Kurdistan ], another { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets.A 32-year-old from a village near { Mosul } [ Mosul ] with a wife and three children, he was a { construction worker } [ Construction worker ] for a Turkish company when { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the { Americans } [ United States ] there in { 2004 } [ Battle of Wadi El Natrun ] and { 2006 } [ Battle of Wadi El Natrun ]. He joined { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the { Kurds } [ Kurdistan ] {. } [ Kurdistan ] \"But that's not the main motivation, { religious } [ Religion ] conviction is more important. I came to { IS } [ Islam ] through my { faith } [ Faith ] and { religious } [ Religion ] principles.\"\"If I had my { time } [ Time (magazine) ] over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or { Allah } [ Allah ] will decree some other fate for me.\"Taming MosulDefeating IS militarily is less about its own strengths and vulnerabilities than it is about the deficiencies of the forces arrayed against it. IS is as strong as the weaknesses of the { failed states } [ Failed state ] whose collapse into \"savagery\" has left room for it to take root and grow.Iraq and { Syria } [ Syria ] have to be the primary focus, as the commander of Coalition forces, Lt Gen { Sean MacFarland } [ Sean MacFarland ], spelled out in February 2016:\"The campaign has three objectives: one, to destroy the { Isil } [ Isil ] parent tumour in Iraq and { Syria } [ Syria ] by collapsing its power centres in { Mosul } [ Mosul ] and { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ]; two, to combat the emerging metastasis of the { Isil } [ Isil ] tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack.\"It goes without saying that { Coalition } [ Coalition ] air strikes, deadly and effective as they are, have their limitations. Only in co-ordination with cohesive, motivated ground forces can the territory taken by { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] be regained. And that's the crippling problem, in both countries.The { Kurds } [ Kurds ] in the north of both { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] have made considerable progress in pushing IS back from areas they regard as theirs, with the help of Coalition air strikes. But they are neither capable of going all the way, nor should they: in both countries, they would stir up acute communal sensitivities in the { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] { Arab } [ Arab world ] areas where { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] is rooted.Pro-government forces in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] largely dislodged IS from { Diyala } [ Diyala Governorate ] province and the { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ] area north of the capital in 2015, but that was mainly the work of Iranian-backed { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militias who leapt to the defence of { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] and the south as IS descended in June 2014 after the army collapsed.Using them in mainly { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] areas is fraught with risk.Ramadi, the provincial capital of { Anbar } [ Al Anbar Governorate ] to the west, was recaptured at the end of 2015 in an offensive spearheaded by the government's US-built Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), with the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militias kept out of this { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] stronghold. The { city } [ City ] was left in { ruins } [ Ruins ], its entire { population } [ Population ] fled.When that even more iconic { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] citadel, { Falluja } [ Falluja ], became the focus of the next government offensive, launched at the end of May, the limitations of the official state forces soon became even more apparent.The CTS spearheaded the advance from the south, but on other fronts, it was primarily the Iranian-backed { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militias which were fighting their way in around the other sides of the city, backed by an array of government units and some anti-IS { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] tribal elements.The militias were not supposed to enter the limits of the city itself, but they swiftly took control of the deeply { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] surroundings, amidst allegations of abuses against civilian males detained for vetting as { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] suspects.The { Falluja } [ Falluja ] battle did not augur well for the much bigger challenge awaiting in the north - { Mosul } [ Mosul ], something like 10 times the size, and the real core of the IS state enterprise.The { Americans } [ United States ] would clearly have liked { Mosul } [ Mosul ] to be retaken by the end of 2016, as a legacy item for { President } [ President of the United States ] { Obama } [ Barack Obama ].But the ferocious battle for { Falluja } [ Falluja ] would inevitably take a toll on the { CTS } [ Cuerpo de Trabajadores ], whose already limited numbers could not be easily or swiftly replenished. The alternative, to accord an even bigger role to the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militias in this heavily { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] area, could be laden with perilous consequences.Over in { Syria } [ Syria ] {, } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] was also under pressure by mid-2016. Something of a { race } [ Racing ] was developing for the { group } [ List of designated terrorist groups ]'s supposed { headquarters } [ Headquarters ] at { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ].Despite objections from their Turkish Nato allies, the US-led Coalition was providing backing with air strikes and advisers to the { Syrian Democratic Forces } [ Syrian Democratic Forces ] (SDF), largely composed of seasoned Kurdish { Popular Protection Units } [ Popular Protection Units ] ( {YPG } [ Popular Protection Units ]) fighters leavened with some Sunni Arab elements, as they slowly eroded IS control in northern border areas controlling the approaches to { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ].At the same time, { Syrian } [ Syria ] government forces supported by Iranian-backed Shia militias and { Russian } [ Russia ] air power were starting to thrust eastwards from { Hama } [ Hama ] towards { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ].Who would get there first, and with what consequences for the future shape of { Syria } [ Syria ]?The civil war truce engineered by the { Russians } [ Russia ] and { Americans } [ United States ] in February had largely broken down, and the { Geneva } [ Geneva ] peace talks had stalled, leaving all the cards up in the air in a conflict whose outcome has always defied prediction.But even if IS was to lose all its territory in { Syria } [ Syria ] - still a distant prospect in mid-2016 - it is much less deeply embedded in the { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] population there than in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq ] Disgruntled Syrian Sunnis have many other vehicles for pressing their grievances against the { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] regime. Ten times the size of { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ] {. } [ Raqqa ] And that's not the only reason for its significance.\" {Mosul } [ Mosul ] is the beating heart of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {,\" says a senior } [ Western world ] { Western } [ Western world ] official in northern { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {. } [ Iraq ] \" {IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] is essentially an { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] creation. The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] political entity in { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. From the { West } [ Western world ], it's looked at as a kind of crazed { cult } [ Cult ] {. } [ Cult ] It's not. Here in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] it represents an important { constituency } [ Electoral district ] {. } [ Electoral district ] It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population.\"But if a { Mosul } [ Mosul ] offensive does go ahead, the fear is that a wrongly-conceived short-term victory, if it is achieved, will turn into long-term disaster, given the total lack of national reconciliation between { Sunnis } [ Sunni Islam ] and { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] in the wake of the sectarian carnage that followed { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ]'s overthrow in 2003.Sunni grievances in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] are such that if { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] did not exist {, } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] it would have to be invented {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] Without reconciliation and a sense of { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] empowerment and partnership in a credible national project, IS in some shape or form will always be there, just as the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] are now resurgent in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] despite everything that was done to oust them.But the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes that IS could be badly damaged if the { Coalition } [ Coalition of the willing ] succeeds in one of its top-priority tasks - to kill { Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ].Leaders have been killed before, and replaced with little obvious effect on the course of history. But { Hashemi } [ Hashemi ] believes { Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr Baghdadi ] is different.\" {IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {'s } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] future depends on { Baghdadi } [ Abu Bakr Baghdadi ] {,\" he says } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. One part would stay on his track and announce a new { caliphate } [ Caliphate ]. Another would split off and return to { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] Others would turn into { gangs } [ Gang ] following whoever is strongest.\"\"The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] ideas with { Baathist } [ Ba'athism ] intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation.\" {Hashemi } [ Hashemi ] believes only { Baghdadi } [ Abdul Hamid II ] can hold it together. There have been numerous false reports of him being hit in air strikes, but he appears to be stubbornly and elusively still alive, not seen in public since that mosque appearance in early July 2014.The { Americans } [ United States ] are unlikely to rest until they have killed { Baghdadi } [ Abdul Nasser Baghdadi ], not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an { American } [ United States ] NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015.But even if they do get him, and even if { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] does break up, the { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] problem in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] will not go away.Capitalising on chaosIS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial options beyond the \"parent tumour\" of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Syria } [ Syria ] {. } [ Syria ]Libya proved the most promising.IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] { Christian } [ Christianity ] workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a { Libyan } [ Libya ] beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the { Mediterranean } [ Mediterranean Sea ] as a warning to the \"crusader\" { European } [ Europe ] countries on the other side of the sea.The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in { Libya } [ Libya ], an { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a { US } [ United States ] air strike on the same day { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] struck in { Paris } [ Paris ], 13 November 2015.The { US } [ United States ] and its allies were powerless to halt { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] advances in { Libya } [ Libya ] {. } [ Libya ]The group took over a big stretch of the coast around the central city of { Sirte } [ Sirte ], which was to { Muammar Gaddafi } [ Muammar Gaddafi ] what { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ] was to { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ]. Another { American } [ United States ] air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on { Western } [ Western world ] tourists in his native { Tunisia } [ Tunisia ].By the summer of 2016, however, the militants were under pressure in { Libya } [ Libya ] too. Militias loyal to the { Government of National Accord } [ Government of National Accord ], which had been born out of { UN } [ United Nations ] efforts in late March, were pressing in on { Sirte } [ Sirte ].But { Libya } [ Libya ] remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new { government } [ Government ] far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit.And there was no shortage of other possibilities already beckoning - { Yemen } [ Yemen ], { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], { Somalia } [ Somalia ]. wherever there are dysfunctional states and angry { Muslims } [ Islam ], there are opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] as a dominant brand in the { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] market.Adding the extra risk for the { West } [ Western world ], that that competition could be another spur for spectacular { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] attacks which they know are being actively plotted.Clearly, IS has lost a lot of ground since it reached the high tide of its expansion in 2014 and it is under daily pressure wherever it exists.But the outside powers, working with whatever local forces on the ground they can muster, will have to sustain a monumental effort if they are eventually to succeed in completely uprooting IS militarily, a prospect still far from achievement.If that were to happen, IS would of course mutate back into the shadows as a sinister terrorist outfit with global reach, either plotting or inspiring spectacular strikes both in { Middle East } [ Middle East ] conflict countries and in the { West } [ Western world ], something that is already happening.With no territorial base, its already diminished appeal and credibility as an idealised { Islamic } [ Islam ] state would more or less evaporate.But other voids that it has filled, and the failures and dysfunctions which enabled IS to happen, would remain, because they have been largely unaddressed. The { New York-based } [ New York City ] security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that 27,000 foreign jihadists had made the trip from 86 countries, more than half of them from the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] and { North Africa } [ North Africa ].Clearly, the { caliphate } [ Caliphate ] had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases because of - its graphically publicised brutality. A tribute to its extraordinary skill in using the { internet } [ World Wide Web ] and { social media } [ Social media ] as a { propaganda } [ Propaganda ] and grooming tool.Ten months after vowing to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" the organisation, President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] ruefully acknowledged that IS \"has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world including here in the { United States } [ United States ], and they are targeting { Muslim } [ Islam ] communities around the world\".And he put his finger on the real challenge, monumentally greater than the comparatively simple task of defeating { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] militarily:\"Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,\" he said.On a relatively normal day. there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of { propaganda } [ Propaganda ]. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] offensive in northern { Syria } [ Syria ] and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin. Overwhelmingly, though, the { propagandists } [ Propaganda ] were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life.Fishing and ultraviolenceThe problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of  \"better ideas\" or attractive and compelling visions.They see the ruins of an \" {Arab } [ Arab world ] Spring\" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly.The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like { Syria } [ Syria ] itself, { Libya } [ Libya ], { Yemen } [ Yemen ] and (with { Western } [ Western world ] intervention) { Iraq } [ Iraq ], or the \"deep states\" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of { Egypt } [ Egypt ], more gently in the case of { Tunisia } [ Tunisia ].While many of the { European } [ Europe ] jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the { Arab } [ Arab world ] jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed.The flow of recruits, both fighters and families, leaving their homes in { Europe } [ Europe ] to live under so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] rule in { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ] in { Syria } [ Syria ] has slowed dramatically.\"It reached its peak in 2013-14, when it was far easier for jihadists to cross the 822km-long (510-mile) Turkey-Syria border, when { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] propaganda on social media went largely unchallenged, and when { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] was on a roll militarily, seizing ever more territory across northern { Syria } [ Syria ] and north-western { Iraq } [ Iraq ].\"While all three of those factors have now changed to the detriment of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ], the underlying factors propelling young { Britons } [ United Kingdom ] and { Europeans } [ Europe ] towards joining the group have not gone away.A rare insight into the types of people who volunteer to join { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] came with the emergence in { European } [ Europe ] media in March 2016 of batches of what are believed to be \"secret\" { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] files with personal details of recruits.The data from 2013-14 purported to identify members from at least 40 countries. It included names, addresses, phone numbers and skill sets - a potential treasure trove for { intelligence agencies } [ Intelligence agency ] trying to track and prosecute nationals who have signed up with the group.IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred { Arab } [ Arab world ] idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ] for training and { tertiary education } [ Tertiary education ], but { communism } [ Communism ] is now seen as a busted flush. { Arab socialism } [ Arab socialism ] and { Arab nationalism } [ Arab nationalism ], which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt \"republics\" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.In this vacuum, { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] took up the cause of punishing the { West } [ Western world ] and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:The roots of { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] also lie in a crisis within { Islam } [ Islam ].\" {Isil } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] is not { Islamic } [ Islam ] {,\" said President Obama } [ Barack Obama ], echoing statements by many { Western } [ Western world ] leaders that \"IS has nothing to do with { Islam } [ Islam ] {\". } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]It has.\"It is based on { Islamic } [ Islam ] texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,\" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the { American University of Beirut } [ American University of Beirut ] {. } [ American University of Beirut ] \"I don't say they are not coming out of { Islamic } [ Islam ] tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the { Wahhabis } [ Wahhabism ].\"Hisham al-Hashemi, the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] expert on radical groups, agrees.\"Violent extremism in { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in { Islamic } [ Islam ] law texts relied on by { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of { religious } [ Religion ] discourse, not of a { barbaric } [ Barbarian ] group. Breaking up the { religious } [ Religion ] discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the { extremist } [ Extremism ] groups militarily.\"Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than { Christianity } [ Christianity ] is defined by the { Inquisition } [ Inquisition ], where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes.\" {Salafism } [ Salafi movement ] is spreading in the world, in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], the { Arab } [ Arab world ] countries,\" says Prof Moussalli.He blames the { Saudis } [ Saudi Arabia ] for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of { Islam } [ Islam ], the \"alternative { Islamic } [ Islam ] discourse\" to salafism that President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] would like to see.\"We lost that opportunity with { Egypt } [ Egypt ] {. } [ France national football team ] { Egypt } [ Egypt ] could have paved the way for real change in the area. But { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the { Arab } [ Arab world ] regimes into more { democratic } [ Democracy ] regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it.\" {Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s ultra-conservative { Wahhabi } [ Wahhabism ] religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of { Wahhabism } [ Wahhabism ] that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and other ultra-salafist groups.But { Jamal Khashoggi } [ Jamal Khashoggi ], a leading { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] journalist and writer who spent time in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] and knew { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ], says that simply is not true\"We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt { Wahhabis } [ Wahhabism ].\" { he } [ Stephen Hillyer ] says.\" {IS } [ Islam ] is a form of { Wahhabism } [ Wahhabism ] that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the { siege } [ Siege of Mecca ] of the { Grand Mosque } [ Great Mosque of Mecca ] in { Mecca } [ Mecca ] in 1979 and spread here and there. But { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that { salafism } [ Salafi movement ] can turn radical, just as the { US } [ United States ] { right-wing } [ Right-wing politics ] produces some crazy lunatics.\"Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the { Grand Mosque } [ Grand Mosque of Mecca ], the holiest place in { Islam } [ Islam ], in protest at what they saw as the { Kingdom } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s deviation from the true path.More recently, { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]'s security forces and its { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] minority have in fact been the target of attacks by { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ], and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.But Mr { Khashoggi } [ Mohammad Khashoggi ] agrees that the { Saudis } [ Saudi Arabia ] made a huge mistake when they backed the overthrow of the elected { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] president in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] and the subsequent crackdown on the movement, which has pushed political { Islam } [ Islam ] into the arms of the radicals.\"There were no pictures of { Isis } [ Isis ], { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] or { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] in { Tahrir Square } [ Tahrir Square ] {,\" he says } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. \"It was an opportunity for { democracy } [ Democracy ] in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], but we made a historical blunder for which we are all paying now.\"But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in { Mecca } [ Mecca ] and { Medina } [ Medina ] to which millions of { Muslims } [ Islam ] make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for an unlikely reformation within { Islam } [ Islam ] as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.\"We must accept the fact that { Islam } [ Islam ] has a crisis,\" says a senior { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] { politician } [ Politician ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ].\"IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the { roots } [ Root ], the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], { al-Azhar } [ Al-Azhar Mosque ] the ancient seat of { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] { Islamic } [ Islam ] learning and authority in { Cairo } [ Cairo ].\"\"You can't kill all the { Muslims } [ Muslims ], you need an { Islamic } [ Islam ] reformation.  But { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] and { Qatari } [ Qatar ] money is blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world, too much { oil } [ Oil ], too much { money } [ Money ].\"Regional rivalryIS is at the heart of yet another of the region's burning themes - the strategic geopolitical contest, the game of nations, that is taking place as { Syria } [ Syria ] and { Iraq } [ Iraq ] disintegrate.When the US-led coalition destroyed the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] state in 2003, it was breaking down the wall that was containing { Iran } [ Iran ], the region's { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] superpower, seen as a threat by the { Saudis } [ Saudi Arabia ] and most of their { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] Gulf partners since its { Islamic } [ Islam ] revolution in 1979.Iran had for years been backing anti- {Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] factions in exile. Through those groups, the empowerment of the majority { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] community in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] after 2003 gave { Iran } [ Iran ] unrivalled influence over { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] politics.The arrival of the IS threat led to even more { Iranian } [ Iran ] penetration, arming, training and directing the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia who rose in defence of { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] and the { South } [ Southern Iraq ].\"If it weren't for { Iran } [ Iran ], the democratic experiment in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] would have fallen,\" says Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed { Badr Organisation } [ Badr Organisation ], one of the biggest { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] fighting groups. When they were at the gates of { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] {, } [ Baghdad ] he did nothing.\"For { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] and its allies, { Iranian } [ Iran ] penetration in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] crescent, linking { Iran } [ Iran ], { Iraq } [ Iraq ], { Syria } [ Syria ] under its minority { Alawite } [ Alawites ] leadership, and { Lebanon } [ Lebanon ] dominated by the Iranian-created { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] faction { Hezbollah } [ Hezbollah ].From the outset of the war in { Syria } [ Syria ], the { Saudis } [ Saudi Arabia ] and their { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] partners, and { Turkey } [ Turkey ], backed the { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] rebels in the hope that the overthrow of { Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] would establish { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] majority rule.So then a north-south { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] axis running from Turkey through { Syria } [ Syria ] to { Jordan } [ Jordan ] and { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] would drive a stake through the heart of the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] crescent and foil the { Iranian } [ Iran ] project, as they saw it.That is essentially what IS did in 2014 when it moved back into { Iraq } [ Iraq ], took { Mosul } [ Mosul ] and virtually all the country's { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] areas, and established a { Sunni } [ Sunni Islam ] entity which straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with { Syria } [ Syria ], blocking off { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] parts of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] from { Syria } [ Syria ].If { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] had just stayed put at that point and dug in, who would have shifted them? Had they not gone on to attack the { Kurds } [ Kurdistan ], the { Americans } [ United States ] would not have intervened. Had they not shot down a { Russian } [ Russia ] airliner and attacked { Paris } [ Paris ], the { Russians } [ Russia ] and { French } [ France ] would not have stepped up their involvement.\"Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the { Arab } [ Arab world ] east so there would be no { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] crescent,\" says Prof Moussalli.We may never know why they did it. Perhaps their virulent strain of { salafism } [ Salafi movement ] just had to keep going: Remaining and Expanding.Could they now just row back and settle in their \"state\", stop antagonising people, and eventually gain acceptance, just as { Iran } [ Iran ] has after its own turbulent { revolution } [ Iranian Revolution ] and international isolation?It seems unlikely, for the same driving reasons that they made that escalation in the first place. And even if { IS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] wanted to, the { Americans } [ United States ] also seem set on their course, and they have proven implacable in their pursuit of revenge for { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] outrages.But what is the alternative? Given the problem of assembling capable ground forces, can the { Americans } [ United States ] be complicit in a takeover of { Mosul } [ Mosul ] by Iranian-backed { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militias, and of { Raqqa } [ Raqqa ] by Russian- and Iranian-backed { Syrian } [ Syria ] regime forces or other non-Sunni groups like the { Kurds } [ Kurds ]? Is their hostility to IS so strong that they would watch the { Iranians } [ Iran ] connect up their { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] crescent? And would the { Saudis } [ Saudi Arabia ] and { Turks } [ Turkey ] go along with that?There are no easy answers to any of the challenges posed by IS in all the strands of crisis that it brings together.That's why it's still there.Author: Jim MuirEditor: Raffi BergProduction: Ben Milne, Susannah StevensGraphics: Henry Clarke PriceVideo: Mohamed Madi."},

war was conducted and what planning there was for its aftermath.Here's a timeline of the main developments since the { inquiry } [ Inquiry into Certain Activities of the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the Commission of Inquiry ], under Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] {'s } [ John Chilcot ] leadership, began in July 2009.The report will be published on Wednesday 6 July, it is announced. Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says national security vetting has been completed and that no sections of the report will either be removed or redacted.He confirms that the report will be 2.6 million words long and that families of the 179 { British } [ United Kingdom ] service personnel and civilians killed in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] will have the chance to read it before it is published.It later emerges that the full report will cost { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]787 to purchase while the 150-page executive summary will cost { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]30.Chilcot report to be published on 6 JulySir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says, in a letter written to { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ], that he expects to finish the report - which will be more than two million words long - by April 2016.He says that allowing for { National Security } [ National security ] checking the { PM } [ Prime Minister of Pakistan ] should be in a position to publish the report in \"June or July 2016\".In his latest update, Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] said the process of giving witnesses subject to criticisms in the report the right to reply had yet to be completed, with some individuals yet to respond.Until this happened {, } [ British Army ] he said he could not set out a \"realistic timetable\" for when the report would be completed { but } [ British Army ] hoped to do so as soon as possible {. } [ British Army ]In response, { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] expressed his \"disappointment\" and said he was \"fast losing patience\" over the time being taken. He has asked the { cabinet secretary } [ Cabinet secretary ] Sir { Jeremy Heyward } [ Jeremy Heyward ] to meet with Sir { John } [ John Heyward, Baron John of Faringdon ] to discuss the issues involved.Appearing before the { Foreign Affairs Select Committee } [ Foreign Affairs Select Committee ], Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says he will not give any timetable for publication as he does not want to \"arouse false hopes\".He says the process of giving witnesses criticised in the draft report the right to respond is the primary obstacle standing in the way of completing its work.He says he is not aware of any individuals holding up the process by taking an undue length of time to respond to his findings.He also informs { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] that one of the panel members, { historian } [ Historian ] { Martin Gilbert } [ Martin Gilbert ], has died.Chilcot rejects calls for { Iraq } [ Iraq ] timetableSir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says he will agree to appear before the Commons { Foreign Affairs Committee } [ Foreign Affairs Select Committee ] in early February to answer questions about the inquiry's progress. However, he insists he will not comment on the substance of its work or its likely publication date.The inquiry will not be published until after the { election } [ Election ], Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] confirms. { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] says he would have liked the report to have been published already and criticises the previous government for not establishing it earlier.Deputy { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Australia ] { Nick Clegg } [ Nick Clegg ] says the public would find the latest development \"incomprehensible\".Government minister { Lord Wallace } [ Paul Wallace, Baron Wallace of Wallasey ] says the report is \"largely finished\" and the process of contacting people who have been criticised to give them a right to respond is taking place. He suggests the inquiry should have more staff at the outset to deal with the documents and confirms the report will be \"held back\" until after { May's } [ May 2012 United Kingdom general election ] election if it is not ready for publication by the end of February.More staff needed {William Hague } [ William Hague ], the leader of the { House of Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ], says he hopes the report will be published before the { general election } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] on May 7 2015. { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] says the same but both men say they are \"not in control\" of the timing of the report's conclusion.Hague hopes for 2015 publicationThe UK's top civil servant said the inquiry will \"not be a cover-up in any shape or form\". Sir { Jeremy Heywood } [ Jeremy Heywood ] told { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] that the report would be \"more transparent\" than people were expecting and would include material that would not normally be disclosed \"in a million years\". The { cabinet secretary } [ Cabinet secretary ] said the inquiry was \"happy\" with the documents it could publish after a \"delay of sorts\".Inquiry will tell \"whole story\"Details of the \"gist\" of talks between { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] and { George Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] before the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war are to be published, the inquiry disclosed, but transcripts and full notes of conversations will remain secret at the request of the { Cabinet Office } [ Cabinet Office ].Deal over Bush-Blair documents {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] has said he wants the { Iraq Inquiry } [ Iraq Inquiry ] report to be published as soon as possible and \"resents\" claims he is to blame for its slow progress. The former { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] said he was not blocking any documents and publication would allow him \"restate\" the case for the { 2003 invasion } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ] {. } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ]Blair: I am not to blame for delaysThe US has no veto over the disclosure of communications between { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] and { George W Bush } [ George W. Bush ] regarding war with { Iraq } [ Iraq ], the UK { Cabinet Office } [ Cabinet Office ] said in response to media reports suggesting { Washington } [ United States ] was behind delays to declassification of documents.No 'US veto' over Blair-Bush notesThe inquiry says it cannot proceed with the next phase of its work because key information, including correspondence between { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] and { George W Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ], has yet to be released. Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] said it had not yet agreed with the { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] over the publication of the most \"difficult documents\".Hold-up over access to key documentsThe inquiry announces a further delay to the publication of its report. In a letter to the { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of Canada ], Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says he will not report before the middle of 2013 at the earliest - a decade after the war. The report is \"unprecedented in scope\" and will be about a million words long, he adds. He also confirms the inquiry is seeking a \"dialogue\" with { government } [ Government of Australia ] officials over further access to secret documents, such as notes of { Cabinet } [ Cabinet of Australia ] meetings and correspondence with foreign governments.The inquiry says it will not publish its report until the summer of 2012 at the earliest, six months later than had been anticipated. It says it needs this extra time to \"do justice\" to the issues involved. It also suggests it has not yet been given permission to publish or refer to all the { classified } [ Classified information ] documents it wants to in order to provide the fullest picture of decisions taken. { It } [ Information technology ] says { it } [ Information technology ] needs co-operation from the { government } [ Government ] to do this in a \"satisfactory and timely manner\".The inquiry publishes new { witness } [ Witness ] statements and de-classified papers as it gives an update on its work. In one of the new documents, a former senior { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] official disputes evidence given by former { No 10 } [ No. 10 (Thessaloniki) ] spokesman { Alastair Campbell } [ Alastair Campbell (press secretary) ] in 2010. Michael Laurie contradicts claims made by Mr Campbell that the September 2002 dossier on { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] weapons threat was not designed to \"make the case for war\". Separately, inquiry chairman Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says the final report will not be published until the autumn at the earliest.In the last hearing to be held in public, former { foreign secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] { Jack Straw } [ Jack Straw ] insisted regime change was \"never\" the goal of UK policy towards { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] {. } [ Saddam Hussein ] If the former { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] leader had complied with { UN } [ United Nations ] disarmament demands, he would have remained in power, Mr { Straw } [ David Straw, Baron Straw ] argued. Mr Straw said he believed the military action was justified but expressed his \"deep sorrow\" for the loss of life of { British } [ United Kingdom ] troops and { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] civilians. Bringing an end to the public part of the inquiry, Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] said he would not set an \"artificial deadline\" for publishing its final report while indicating it would take \"some months\".Straw denies regime change planThe { UK } [ United Kingdom ] drew up a list of countries seen as potential threats after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] in a process known as \"draining the swamp\". The { Foreign Office } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] sought to identify countries that could pose \"similar risks\" as { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], senior former diplomat { Stephen Pattison } [ Stephen Pattison ] said. Mr Pattison told the inquiry the process led to { Iraq } [ Iraq ] moving up the political agenda after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] although the phrase \"draining the swamp\" was dropped after it emerged it had been taken from a magazine article.UK drew up 'threat list' after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] was \"reluctant\" to hold { Cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] discussions about { Iraq } [ Iraq ] because he thought details would be leaked, the UK's top civil servant told the inquiry. Sir Gus O'Donnell said Mr { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] did not believe { Cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] was \"a safe space\" in which to debate the issues involved in going to war. The number of informal meetings held under { Mr Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {'s } [ Tony Blair ] premiership meant records of discussions were not \"as complete\" as { he } [ Tony Blair ] would have liked.Blair 'feared { Iraq } [ Iraq ] Cabinet leaks'The former head of the armed forces said { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {'s } [ Tony Blair ] government had lacked coherence and failed to deliver the equipment needed to fight the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war. Admiral { Lord Boyce } [ Robert Boyce, Baron Boyce ] told the inquiry that the { Treasury } [ HM Treasury ] had to be \"beaten over the head\" to deliver on the former prime minister's cash promises, adding that \"half the { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ]\" did not think the country was even at war.The UK's most senior official in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] told ministers that \"heavy-handed\" { US } [ United States ] military tactics made security worse in the year after the { 2003 invasion } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ]. In a de-classified letter released by the { Iraq Inquiry } [ Iraq Inquiry ], Sir { David Richmond } [ David Richmond (judge) ] said the unpopularity of the coalition and failure to supply electricity was \"visible signs\" of lack of progress. He told the Inquiry \"things had started to go badly wrong\" earlier in 2004 but insisted the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] had managed to alter { US } [ United States ] thinking in some areas.US tactics 'hurt post-war { Iraq } [ Iraq ]' {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] was warned by the { UK } [ United Kingdom ]'s top civil servant in 2002 he was getting into a \"dangerous position\" on { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. Former { Cabinet Secretary } [ Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom) ] Lord Wilson said he alerted Mr { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] to the legal issues involved - which he saw as being a brake on military action. In separate evidence, his successor { Lord Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ] said the { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] \"did not know the score\" about { Iraq } [ Iraq ] when they were asked to back military action in March 2003. Ministers had not seen key material on { Iraq } [ Iraq ] policy and were effectively \"imprisoned\" as they knew opposing the use of force would likely have led to { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {'s } [ Tony Blair ] resignation. {Blair } [ Tony Blair ] warned about ' {Iraq } [ Iraq ] dangers' {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] is recalled to give evidence for a second time. He expresses \"deep and profound regret\" about the loss of life suffered by { UK } [ United Kingdom ] personnel and { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] citizens during and after the { 2003 war } [ Iraq War ]. He addresses questions about the war's legality, admitting Former { Attorney General } [ Attorney general ] { Lord Goldsmith } [ Ian Goldsmith ] could have been more closely involved in decision making but his final determination was that war was lawful.Blair's regret for { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war deadThe { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiry published details of evidence given by former spy chief Sir { Richard Dearlove } [ Richard Dearlove ]. Sir { Richard } [ Richard Dearborn ], head of { MI6 } [ Secret Intelligence Service ] in the run-up to the 2003 invasion, said suggestions that he became too close to { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] were \"complete rubbish\". Assessment of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] weapons threat was \"incomplete\", he said, and there was a \"convincing\" case that { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] had \"weaponised\" chemical agents.Spy chief detailed { Iraq } [ Iraq ] worriesSir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] says he is \"disappointed\" the government has chosen not to make public details of correspondence and conversations between { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] and President { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] about { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. The panel - which has seen the material - said disclosure of key extracts would serve to \"illuminate { Mr Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {'s } [ Tony Blair ] position at critical points\" in the run-up to war. But { Cabinet Secretary } [ Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom) ] Sir Gus O'Donnell said publishing the information was not in the \"public interest\" as it could \"prejudice relations\" between countries in future and \"inhibit exchanges\" between leaders.Iraq inquiry criticises secrecyIt emerges that former attorney general { Lord Goldsmith } [ Ian Goldsmith ] was \"uncomfortable\" with statements made by { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] about the legal basis for war in early 2003. In fresh written evidence, { Lord Goldsmith } [ Ian Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith ] - who ultimately concluded that the military action was lawful - said he was concerned about remarks by { Mr Blair } [ Tony Blair ] about the need for a further { UN } [ United Nations ] mandate and suggested they were not compatible with advice given. Mr { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {'s } [ Tony Blair ] spokesman said he would deal with the issue when giving evidence on Friday.Blair to deal with { Goldsmith } [ Ian Goldsmith ] claims {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] will be recalled to give evidence a second time, the inquiry confirms. It says it wants \"more detail\" from a number of witnesses including the former prime minister, former { Foreign Secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] { Jack Straw } [ Jack Straw ] and former { Chief of the Defence Staff } [ Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom) ] { Lord Boyce } [ Paul Boyce, Baron Boyce ]. A number of other prominent figures, including { Cabinet Secretary } [ Cabinet Secretary (Ireland) ] Gus O'Donnell, have been called to give evidence for the first time.Blair recalled for { Iraq } [ Iraq ] questionsSir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] reports on a recent visit to Northern { Iraq } [ Iraq ] where he and one other panel member spoke to senior figures within the { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] regional government about their perspective on the war and its aftermath.Details emerge of how much the inquiry has cost to stage so far. Between July 2009 and March 2010, the inquiry cost an estimated { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]2.2m. Nearly \u00a3800,000 was spent on staff costs while nearly \u00a3600,000 was spent on the public hearings, including room hire and broadcasting.The committee gives an update of its work over the summer: It says it met with 80 serving officers who took part in the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] campaign and also visited the defence medical rehabilitation centre at { Headley Court } [ Headley Court ] to learn about the treatment and rehabilitation of those injured during the war. It also gives details of its visit to { Iraq } [ Iraq ] where, during meetings in { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] and { Basra } [ Basra ], it spoke to government officials including former prime ministers { Ayad Allawi } [ Ayad Allawi ] and Ibrahim Al-Jaafari.Chilcot inquiry visits to { Iraq } [ Iraq ]The intelligence on { Iraq } [ Iraq ]'s weapons threat was not \"very substantial\", former deputy prime minister { Lord Prescott } [ David Prescott ] said. He told the inquiry he was \"nervous\" about the intelligence being presented in 2002 - some of which he said was based on \"tittle-tattle\". Nevertheless, he defended the military action taken as \"legal\" and said he would take the same decision again. Closing public hearings for the summer, inquiry chairman Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] said the committee may choose to recall some witnesses in the autumn and also planned to visit { Iraq } [ Iraq ] in the autumn to hear \" {Iraqi } [ Iraq ] perspectives\".Prescott { Iraq } [ Iraq ] intelligence doubtsTroop commitments in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] created the \"perfect storm\" for an overstretched army, a former Army chief said. Gen Sir { Richard Dannatt } [ Richard Dannatt ] said the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ]'s projections of required troop commitments differed from { Army } [ British Army ] estimates and the { Army } [ British Army ] had come close to \"seizing up\" in 2006. His predecessor Gen Sir { Mike Jackson } [ Mike Jackson (British Army officer) ], in his evidence, said there were too few troops to cope with the aftermath of the invasion.Army 'almost seized up in 2006'The { UN } [ United Nations ] {'s } [ United Nations ] former chief weapons inspector { Hans Blix } [ Hans Blix ] said it is his \"firm view\" that the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war was illegal. Dr Blix said the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] had sought to go down the \" {UN } [ United Nations ] route\" to deal with { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] but failed. Ex-Attorney General { Lord Goldsmith } [ Robert Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith ], who advised the war was lawful on the basis of existing { UN } [ United Nations ] resolutions, \"wriggled about\" in his arguments, he suggested. Dr { Blix } [ Martin Blix ] also said his inspectors had visited 500 sites in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] but found no evidence of { weapons of mass destruction } [ Weapon of mass destruction ] {. } [ Weapon of mass destruction ]Blix 'sure' { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war illegalThe inquiry has been \"too easygoing\" in grilling witnesses about the lead-up to the war, a former { UK } [ United Kingdom ] diplomat said. Carne Ross told the { BBC } [ BBC ] that chairman Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] was running a \"narrow\" investigation, with the standard of questioning \"pretty low\". Mr Ross alleges that the { Foreign Office } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] withheld key documents before he gave evidence to the inquiry recently.Iraq inquiry 'too easygoing'Deputy Prime Minister { Nick Clegg } [ Nick Clegg ] had to clarify the government's position on the { Iraq war } [ Iraq War ] after telling MPs the conflict had been \"illegal\". At { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ]'s questions, Mr { Clegg } [ Tony Clegg ] said { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] {'s } [ Labour Party (UK) ] former foreign secretary { Jack Straw } [ Jack Straw ] would have to account for his role in the \"disastrous\" decision to invade. Mr { Clegg } [ Alistair Clegg ] later stressed his opinion was a \"long-held\" personal one and the { government } [ Government of Canada ] awaited the outcome of the { Chilcot } [ Chilcot Inquiry ] inquiry.Clegg clarifies { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war stanceThe invasion of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] \"substantially\" increased the terrorist threat to the UK, the former head of { MI5 } [ MI5 ] said. Baroness { Manningham-Buller } [ Angela Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller ] told the inquiry the action \"radicalised\" a generation of young people, including UK citizens, and she was not \"surprised\" that UK nationals were involved in the { 7/7 bombings } [ 7 July 2005 London bombings ] in { London } [ London ]. The { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] on { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] threat was not \"substantial enough\" to justify the action {, } [ United States Department of State list of Foreign Affairs acronyms ] she argued.Iraq war 'raised terror threat'Helping { British } [ United Kingdom ] troops seriously wounded in Iraq was a \"real challenge\" but welfare support has improved as a result, defence officials said. Improved battlefield care saved more lives but more { soldiers } [ Soldier ] were left with multiple injuries, senior personnel { officers } [ Officer (armed forces) ] told the inquiry. Air Marshall { David Pocock } [ David Pocock ] said the military had \"learnt a lot of lessons\" about helping casualties. But he accepted support for bereaved families was often not good enough.Iraq wounded 'real challenge'Legal concerns were partly to blame for the government not being open with the families of troops killed in Iraq, a former minister said. Adam Ingram told the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiry lawyers advised caution to officials about their wording in case it was taken as an admission of liability. He said it was \"very wearing\" for { ministers } [ Minister (government) ] to have to meet bereaved relatives who blamed them for deaths. Legal fears 'hit { Iraq } [ Iraq ] openess'The { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] should have seen all the arguments on the legality of the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war, a former senior minister has said. Lord Boateng said it would have been \"helpful\" to see then { Attorney General } [ Attorney general ] Lord Goldsmith's full legal deliberations in the run-up to war. Military action would be lawful, { Lord Goldsmith } [ Robert Goldsmith ] ruled days before the invasion, but critics said his earlier reservations were not made clear. But { Lord Boateng } [ Yang Wen-Tung, Lord Boateng ] said he believed the invasion was \"right\".Ministers wanted more { Iraq } [ Iraq ] 'trust'Dealing with { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] through sanctions and other methods was a \"very available\" alternative to military action, a former { UK } [ United Kingdom ] diplomat said. Carne Ross, who resigned over the war, told the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiry that the UK did not work hard enough to make its pre-2003 policy of containment work. { Officials } [ Official ] trying to argue for this approach felt \"very beleaguered\".Iraq war options not consideredThe inquiry said it had taken evidence from 35 people in private. Witnesses who have appeared behind closed doors included Sir { Richard Dearlove } [ Richard Dearlove ], a former head of { MI6 } [ Secret Intelligence Service ] {. } [ Secret Intelligence Service ] Individuals to have taken part in private as well as public hearings included Sir { John Scarlett } [ John Scarlett ], Sir { David Manning } [ David Manning (judge) ] and Sir { Jeremy Greenstock } [ Jeremy Greenstock ]. Inquiry chairman Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] said evidence was taken in private where doing so in public would have damaged { national security } [ National security ] or { international relations } [ International relations ]. Inquiry hears from 35 witnesses in private. { Tehran } [ Iran ] did not wish to \"destabilise\" efforts to establish a government after { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] {'s } [ Saddam Hussein ] overthrow, Sir { Richard Dalton } [ Richard Dalton ] told the inquiry. Claims of { Iranian } [ Iran ] support for { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and the { counter-insurgency } [ Counter-insurgency ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] that began in 2004 were \"exaggerated\", he argued.Blair 'misread { Iran } [ Iran ] view on { Iraq } [ Iraq ]''The government \"let down\" the families of { British } [ United Kingdom ] troops killed in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] in terms of the support given to them, ex-Defence Secretary { Bob Ainsworth } [ Bob Ainsworth ] said. He told the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiry that the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ] \"simply did not get it right\" in terms of the overall \"welfare package\" given to families. Communication was often inconsistent and inquests into deaths in service took too long. However, he defended { government } [ Government ] action over pay and compensation for injuries as well as the medical care given to the wounded.Bereaved { Iraq } [ Iraq ] families 'let down'The { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] government should have \"sorted out\" its plans to rebuild { Iraq } [ Iraq ] after the war much sooner, a former minister told the inquiry. Sally Keeble said the { Department for International Development } [ Department for International Development ] {'s } [ Department for International Development ] role was still under debate \"close to the action\" starting in 2003.Iraq plans too late ex-minister saysThe inquiry publishes previously secret documents relating to the legality of the war after they were de-classified by the government. Details of former { Attorney General } [ Attorney General for England and Wales ] { Lord Goldsmith } [ Ian Goldsmith ]'s draft legal advice to { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] on 12 February 2003 were published on the inquiry's website, as well as a note he sent to former { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] on the issue two weeks earlier. The inquiry also heard from the former head of the { Diplomatic Service } [ Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service ], { Lord Jay } [ Robert Jay, 1st Viscount Jay ], who said he was \"very uncomfortable\" with the idea of military action without the backing of the { UN } [ United Nations ]. However, he said he did not \"dissent\" from { Lord Goldsmith } [ Robert Goldsmith ] {'s } [ Robert Goldsmith ] conclusion that the war was lawful.Iraq war legal advice publishedThe inquiry resumed hearings after a four-and-a-half month break for the { general election } [ General election ]. It heard that former { French } [ France ] { President } [ President (government title) ] { Jacques Chirac } [ Jacques Chirac ] believed the invasion was a \"dangerous venture\". Sir { John Holmes } [ John Holmes (ambassador) ], the UK's ambassador to { France } [ France ] in 2003, said { Paris } [ Paris ] saw efforts to get a further { UN } [ United Nations ] resolution to authorise military action as a \"trap\". Also, the man sent to advise { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] officials on building up its { police } [ Police ] force after the { invasion } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ] said there was not enough focus or resources given to the task. Douglas Brand said { British } [ United Kingdom ] and { US } [ United States ] officials had unrealistic expectations about how quickly officers could be trained and believed policing structures could be \"imposed\" quickly after the war despite the unstable situation in the country.Iraq probe told of { Chirac } [ Jacques Chirac ] concernForeign Secretary { David Miliband } [ David Miliband ] said the { United Nations } [ United Nations ] had been \"feeble\" in following up threats made to { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] in the run-up to the { Iraq war } [ Iraq War ]. He added that most { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] felt they had been liberated from tyranny since the fall of { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] and the situation in the country showed \"chaotic potential\". Ministry of Defence permanent under-secretary Sir { Bill Jeffrey } [ Bill Jeffrey ] said the expansion of UK involvement in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] did not mean forces left { Iraq } [ Iraq ] at the wrong time. Concluding hearings until after the UK general election, inquiry chairman { Sir John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] urged political parties not to use its proceedings as a campaign issue.UN feeble with { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] - { Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ]Prime Minister { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] denied starving UK armed forces of equipment, insisting at the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiry that every request made while he was chancellor was met. Making his long-awaited appearance, the { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] said he fully backed the { 2003 war } [ Iraq War ] and had been kept \"in the loop\" by { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] in the build-up. However, he expressed \"sadness\" for the deaths of { British } [ United Kingdom ] soldiers and { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] citizens.PM denies { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war cash curbsThe full story: { Brown } [ Gordon Brown ]'s appearanceThe inquiry says Prime Minister { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] will give evidence on 5 March. International Development Secretary { Douglas Alexander } [ Douglas Alexander, Baron Alexander ofedding ] will also appear on that day while { Foreign Secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] { David Miliband } [ David Miliband ] will appear on 8 March.Sir { Kevin Tebbit } [ Kevin Tebbit ], a retired permanent secretary to the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ], claimed { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] had \"guillotined\" \u00a31bn from defence spending in December 2003, while efforts to rebuild { Iraq } [ Iraq ] were ongoing. This created the need for a \"very major savings exercise\", he said. Mr { Brown } [ David Brown (New Zealand politician) ] rejected the allegations later in { Parliament } [ New Zealand Parliament ] {. } [ New Zealand ] Also giving evidence, former Defence Secretary { John Reid } [ John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan ] said the \"failures of { Vietnam } [ Vietnam ]\" haunted the US military during the earlier part of its time in { Iraq } [ Iraq ], hindering reconstruction efforts. And former human rights envoy { Ann Clwyd } [ Ann Clwyd ] said she believed there was \"no other option\" than to remove { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] to prevent further persecution of a large section of the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] population.Brown denies defence 'guillotine' {Vietnam } [ Vietnam ] 'affected { Iraq } [ Iraq ] planning''No option' in removing { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {'s } [ Tony Blair ] cabinet was \"misled\" into thinking the war with { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was legal, ex-International Development Secretary { Clare Short } [ Clare Short ] told the inquiry. She said { Attorney General } [ Attorney General for England and Wales ] { Lord Goldsmith } [ Robert Goldsmith, 1st Baron Goldsmith ] had been \"leaned on\" to change his advice before the invasion and that the { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] had not properly discussed events leading up to the war. She also suggested she had been \"conned\" into remaining in the { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] despite her misgivings about the war by the promise of a lead role in post-war reconstruction efforts.Cabinet misled on { Iraq } [ Iraq ] says { ShortMinisters } [ Minister for Shortlisted Ministers ] were warned of a \"serious risk\" the military would not have all the equipment it needed to invade { Iraq } [ Iraq ], the inquiry heard. Air Chief Marshal Sir { Jock Stirrup } [ Jock Stirrup ], the head of the armed forces, said defence chiefs \"simply didn't have enough time\" to source everything they wanted and more time to prepare would have made a \"significant difference\". During six hours of questioning, the former { prime minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] mounted a robust defence of his decision to take the UK to war, describing the former { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] leader as a \"monster\" and a threat to the world. There was \"no { conspiracy } [ Conspiracy ], deceit or { deception } [ Deception ]\" behind the decisions he took and no \"covert\" deal with { President } [ President of the United States ] { Bush } [ George H.

At the time he was convinced the regime possessed { weapons of mass destruction } [ Weapon of mass destruction ] while it was clear { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] planned to step up weapons programmes once he was able to.I'd do it again { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] tells { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiryThe full story: { Blair } [ Tony Blair ]'s appearance {Lord Goldsmith } [ Ian Goldsmith ] told the inquiry he changed his view on the legality of military action but denied this was down to political pressure. While initially believing a second { UN } [ United Nations ] resolution was necessary, he concluded otherwise in the middle of February 2003 after consulting with lawyers and diplomats in the { US } [ United States ] about the meaning of existing { UN } [ United Nations ] agreements. He issued a definitive judgement only days before the war because the military said they needed one to go ahead. He made clear he stood by his decision that the invasion was lawful. Inquiry chairman Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] also said he shared { Lord Goldsmith } [ Peter Goldsmith ] {'s } [ Peter Goldsmith ] frustration that not all relevant documents had been declassified.Goldsmith admits { Iraq } [ Iraq ] legal shiftAnger at documents secrecyStraw defends ignoring adviceTwo former { Foreign Office } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] legal advisers told the inquiry that, in their opinion, the invasion of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was unlawful without the express backing of the { United Nations } [ United Nations ]. Sir { Michael Wood } [ Michael Wood, Baron Wood of Woodland ], the department's chief legal adviser, said { Foreign Secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] { Jack Straw } [ Jack Straw ] rejected his advice that a further mandate from the { Security Council } [ United Nations Security Council ] was needed to justify military action. His deputy { Elizabeth Wilmshurst } [ Elizabeth Wilmshurst ], who resigned in protest at the decision to go to war, said the way in which the legal arguments were presented and assessed had been \"lamentable\".Iraq legal decision 'lamentable'Straw rejected Iraq legal adviceThe inquiry heard from { Des Browne } [ Des Browne ] and { John Hutton } [ John Hutton (judge) ], defence secretaries between May 2006 and July 2009. He said he never came under pressure to shift resources from { Iraq } [ Iraq ] to { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] but questioned the ability of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] armed forces to fight two major campaigns at the same time. Mr Hutton said the death toll among { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] had been \"disastrous\" but the invasion was justified as { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was now a { democracy } [ Democracy ] and not a threat to regional security. But he said a shortage of { helicopters } [ Helicopter ] was a \"factor\" in the campaign.Iraq deaths 'difficult'Inquiry chairman Sir { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] confirms that { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] will appear at the inquiry before the { general election } [ General election ]. He said Mr { Brown } [ Robert Brown, Baron Brown of Wallasey ] had written to the inquiry stating that he would be prepared to give evidence whenever \"you see fit\" and would be \"happy\" to do so before the election. Sir John said the hearing was likely to take place in late February or early March at a date to be agreed. Opposition parties, who had criticised the decision to delay { Mr Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] {'s } [ Gordon Brown ] appearance until after the { election } [ 1998 Australian federal election ], welcomed the change of plan {. } [ Gordon Brown ]PM to face { inquiry } [ Inquiry ] before { election } [ Election ]Supporting the invasion was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life, { Jack Straw } [ Jack Straw ] told the { inquiry } [ Inquiry ]. The { foreign secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] said he was aware the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] could not have gone to { war } [ World War II ] without his backing. He said he had taken the decision \"very reluctantly\" as he disagreed with the { US } [ United States ] objective of regime change as the basis for action but he believed { Iraq } [ Iraq ] posed a threat. He said the 45-minute claim in the September 2002 dossier on { Iraq } [ Iraq ]'s weapons threat was an error that \"has haunted us ever since\".Iraq my 'hardest choice' - { Straw } [ John Straw, Baron Straw ]Including the 45-minute claim in an intelligence dossier on Iraq's weapons was \"asking for trouble\", { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ]'s former security co-ordinator Sir { David Omand } [ David Omand ] said. He described it as a \"bit of local colour\" which was used because there was little other detail that the { intelligence services } [ Intelligence agency ] were happy to be included in the September 2002 dossier.45-minute claim 'a bit of colour'Former defence secretary { Geoff Hoon } [ Geoff Hoon ] - the first cabinet minister from the period to appear before the inquiry - said the first he heard of the controversial \"45 minute claim\" on { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] weapons was when he read about it in the September 2002 dossier. Separately he also said he had opposed the deployment of { British } [ United Kingdom ] troops to { Helmand } [ Helmand Province ], before forces were reduced in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {. } [ Iraq ]No { Iraq } [ Iraq ] deal 'signed in blood'It emerges that the inquiry met in private on Friday following a request by General Sir { John Reith } [ John Reith, 1st Baron Reith ], the man who ran { British } [ United Kingdom ] operations during the war. He told the inquiry that the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ] had been \"reluctant\" to begin vital logistical planning for a potential invasion as late as December 2002 for fear of alerting the public. Ultimately, he said there were no equipment shortages but some kit could not found once it was sent to { Iraq } [ Iraq ].Iraq inquiry meets in privateUK forces in southern Iraq had to rely on their US allies for helicopters because all UK aircraft were deployed in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], a senior military officer told the inquiry. Major General { Graham Binns } [ Graham Binns ], who commanded coalition forces in { Basra } [ Basra ] from mid-2007 until early 2008, said there was a \"major gap\" in attack helicopters but those provided by the { US } [ United States ] were \"magnificent\".Ex-No 10 spokesman { Alastair Campbell } [ Alastair Campbell (politician) ] was attacked for suggesting former { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ] minister and war critic { Clare Short } [ Clare Short ] was barred from key meetings because she could not be trusted. Former head of the { civil service } [ Civil service ], { Lord Turnbull } [ Malcolm Turnbull ], said his remarks were \"very poor\" and Ms { Short } [ Lisa Short ] {'s } [ Stephen Short ] views should have been respected. He also said { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] must explain recent comments that he would have backed the war even if he had known { Iraq } [ Iraq ] had no { weapons of mass destruction } [ Weapon of mass destruction ] {. } [ Iraq ] In a typically combative performance, stretching over nearly five hours, he said the dossier could have been \"clearer\" - but he insisted the government did not \"misrepresent\" the threat they posed by { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] {'s } [ Saddam Hussein ] weapons. He also denied claims Mr { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] \"shifted\" to back regime change after a { US } [ United States ] summit, pouring scorn on the evidence given to the inquiry by former UK ambassador to the { US } [ United States ] Sir { Christopher Meyer } [ Christopher Meyer ].Campbell defends { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war dossierLt Gen Sir { Richard Shirreff } [ Richard Shirreff ] said the { British Army } [ British Army ] was effectively providing \"no security at all\" in the southern { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] city of { Basra } [ Basra ] by mid-2006. The former { commanding officer } [ Commanding officer ] of the multi-national { division } [ Division (military) ] in south-east { Iraq } [ Iraq ] told the inquiry that 200 troops were attempting to control a city of 1.3 million people, with { militias } [ Militia ] \"filling the gap\". He also said troops had not been employed effectively and criticised equipment levels provided for the mission in southern { Iraq } [ Iraq ].Basra security was 'non-existent'The complexity of negotiating the { British } [ United Kingdom ] exit from { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] in 2009 was revealed. Peter Watkins from the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ] said that one lesson learnt was that the coalition allies should have sought a single agreement with the { Iraqis } [ Iraq ]. \"We should have applied the { Balkans } [ Balkans ] principle of in together out together\". Foreign Office officials described with some optimism how life for the people of { Basra } [ Basra ] had steadily improved, six years after the invasion. Lt Gen Barney White-Spunner of the Multi- National Division South East said the { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] had asked the { British } [ United Kingdom ] to carry out aerial bombing of areas which had not been \"sufficiently vetted\", where there could be civilian casualties. UK forces refused to launch these attacks. In the event, the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militias \"crumbled quickly\" in the face of the Iraqi-led operation.Witnesses described the period leading to the drawdown of { British } [ United Kingdom ] forces in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {. } [ United Kingdom ] Jon Day from the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ] confirmed that the UK held talks with the { Mahdi Army } [ Peace Companies ] militia in { Basra } [ Basra ] three months before { British } [ United Kingdom ] troops pulled out of the city and moved to the airport. Lt Gen Sir { Peter Wall } [ Peter Wall ] said young soldiers would complain how bored they had become in { Basra } [ Basra ] in the final months of the operation. Christopher Prentice, the { British } [ United Kingdom ] ambassador to { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] (2007-09), said the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] Prime Minister, { Nouri al Maliki } [ Nouri al Maliki ] was \"very very keen\" on the relationship with { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].Sir { William Patey } [ William Patey ], the former UK ambassador to { Iraq } [ Iraq ], told the inquiry some post-war ambitions for the country were \"probably higher than the ability to deliver\". He talked about the difficulties of drafting a { constitution } [ Constitution ] and setting up an effective { police } [ Police ] force. General Sir { Nick Houghton } [ Nick Houghton ], former chief of joint operations, said that, from 2006, there had been pressure to reduce { British } [ United Kingdom ] force levels in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] to concentrate on the new mission in { Helmand } [ Helmand Province ].Ambassador queries { Iraq } [ Iraq ] ambitionThe bombing of the UN headquarters in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] in 2003 had \"a very serious impact\" on UK efforts to rebuild the country, former overseas aid official { Jim Drummond } [ Jim Drummond ] told the inquiry.UN { Iraq } [ Iraq ] blast 'hindered { UK } [ United Kingdom ] work' {Britain } [ United Kingdom ] may have had \"second thoughts\" about its participation in the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war had it foreseen the mayhem that would occur in the years after the invasion, the inquiry was told. Sir { John Sawers } [ John Sawers ], a former adviser to { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] and now head of { MI6 } [ Secret Intelligence Service ], said the level of violence in post-war { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was \"unprecedented\". Earlier, top commander Lt Gen Sir { Robert Fry } [ Robert Fry (British Army officer) ] said the invasion could have failed without the backing of { UK } [ United Kingdom ] troops.Iraq violence 'unprecedented'Key decisions taken in post-war Iraq were examined as Sir { Jeremy Greenstock } [ Jeremy Greenstock ] made his second appearance before the inquiry. He said the { US } [ United States ] thwarted { UK } [ United Kingdom ] efforts to give the { UN } [ United Nations ] a \"leading political role\" in post-war { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { US } [ United States ] officials did not listen to { UK } [ United Kingdom ] advice or even keep them informed of major developments. Lt General { John Kiszely } [ John Kiszely ] quoted former { US } [ United States ] Defence Secretary { Donald Rumsfeld } [ Donald Rumsfeld ] as saying growing attacks in 2004 were the work of a \"bunch of no hopers\". Lt Gen { Jonathon Riley } [ Jonathon Riley ], who commanded forces in the south of { Iraq } [ Iraq ], said the { US } [ United States ] had \"no choice\" but to disband the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army - a decision criticised by many { UK } [ United Kingdom ] officials.Iraq counter-insurgency 'not recognised'Former { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] has yet to appear before the { Chilcot } [ Chilcot Inquiry ] inquiry. However, asked about the decision to go to war in a { BBC } [ BBC ] { TV } [ Television ] interview, he said he would have done so even if he had known { Iraq } [ Iraq ] had no { weapons of mass destruction } [ Weapon of mass destruction ]. Reacting to the remarks, Defence Secretary { Bob Ainsworth } [ Bob Ainsworth ] said he was \"surprised\" by them while Sir { Ken MacDonald } [ Ken MacDonald (barrister) ], a former director of public prosecutions, has accused Mr Blair of \"alarming subterfuge\" in justifying the war. Sir { John } [ John Churchill, Jr. ], the current head of { MI6 } [ Secret Intelligence Service ], visited { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] in January that year for informal talks with the incoming { Bush } [ George H.

Lt Gen { Frederick Viggers } [ Frederick Viggers ] said senior officials, including ministers, needed more training to deal with the complexities involved in mounting an invasion. Sir { Hilary Synnott } [ Hilary Synnott ], the { Coalition Provisional Authority } [ Coalition Provisional Authority ]'s (CPA) regional co-ordinator for Southern { Iraq } [ Iraq ] from July 2003 until January 2004, said the long-term plan for the governance of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] was \"deeply flawed\". He said { bureaucracy } [ Bureaucracy ], resource and expertise problems had hampered the { coalition } [ Coalition ] {'s } [ United Nations ] mission {. } [ United Nations ] Lt Gen Sir { Graeme Lamb } [ Graeme Lamb ] likened the { CPA } [ Certified Public Accountant ] to \"dancing with a broken doll\".Army chief lambasts { Iraq } [ Iraq ] 'amateurs'Ex-spy chief Sir { John Scarlett } [ John Scarlett ] said there was \"no conscious intention\" to manipulate information about { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] weapons. He denied being under pressure to \"firm up\" the September 2002 dossier which contained the claim { Iraq } [ Iraq ] could use { WMD } [ Weapon of mass destruction ] within 45 minutes of { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ]'s order. Former permanent secretary at the { Department for International Development } [ Department for International Development ], Sir { Suma Chakrabarti } [ Suma Chakrabarti ], said UK aid officials had \"scanty\" evidence of the situation in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion. Air Marshall Sir { Brian Burridge } [ Brian Burridge ], who led UK ground forces in { Iraq } [ Iraq ], said he was told by a top { US } [ United States ] commander 10 months before that it was a \"matter of when not if\" it went into { Iraq } [ Iraq ].No { Iraq } [ Iraq ] manipulation says ScarlettIraq details 'scanty' before warArmy chief 'told of US { Iraq } [ Iraq ] aims'A senior { British } [ United Kingdom ] officer said he urged { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] to delay the invasion of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] two days before the conflict. Maj Gen { Tim Cross } [ Tim Cross (general) ], who liaised with the { US } [ United States ] on reconstruction efforts, said planning for after the conflict was \"woefully thin\". A senior { diplomat } [ Diplomat ] also told the inquiry the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] felt \"helpless\" to deal with the kidnappings of its citizens in following the war. Edward Chaplin, former UK ambassador to { Iraq } [ Iraq ], said the taking hostage and killing of Ken Bigley and Margaret Hassan had been \"terrible\" events.Officer urged { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] to delay warUK felt 'hopeless' over hostagesThe { US } [ United States ] first revealed its military plans at a meeting in June 2002, the { UK } [ United Kingdom ]'s chief military adviser to the { US Central Army Command } [ United States Central Army Command ] told the inquiry. Major General { David Wilson } [ David Wilson (U.S. Army officer) ] said there was no talk of { Iraq } [ Iraq ] among top { US } [ United States ] commanders in Spring 2002 but this \"changed suddenly\" in June when he said the \"curtain was drawn back\" on their thinking. Asked to comment on the plans, he said the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] could not back them without { political } [ Politics ] and { legal } [ Law ] approval. Dominic Asquith, { British } [ United Kingdom ] ambassador to { Iraq } [ Iraq ] in 2006-7, said the { Treasury } [ HM Treasury ] refused to provide extra cash for reconstruction projects in { Basra } [ Basra ] which he said was \"extremely frustrating\".Moment ' {US } [ United States ] revealed war plans'Treasury accused over { Iraq } [ Iraq ] fundsThe { US } [ United States ] \"assumed\" the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] would contribute troops to the invasion even if there was no UN backing, the head of { UK } [ United Kingdom ] armed forces at the time told the inquiry. Admiral { Lord Boyce } [ John Boyce, 1st Baron Boyce ] said the \"shutters came down\" in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] when UK officials pointed out they would not be able to back the war without { Parliamentary } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] approval. He also criticised { Clare Short } [ Clare Short ], { Secretary of State for International Development } [ Secretary of State for International Development ] during the invasion, saying her department had effectively hampered reconstruction efforts and been \"particularly uncooperative\".US 'assumed UK war involvement'Short's ' {Iraq } [ Iraq ] team sat in tents'In a session dominated by the aftermath of the war, a senior { Foreign Office } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] official said there was a \"dire\" lack of planning in the { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] administration for a post- {Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. Edward Chaplin, head of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] department in 2003, said the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] raised the issue many times but its concerns had been largely overlooked. His colleague, Sir { Peter Ricketts } [ Peter Ricketts ], said the UK could have achieved more in its role in stabilising and rebuilding southern { Iraq } [ Iraq ] after the { invasion } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ] if it had been given more resources.Planning for post-war { Iraq } [ Iraq ] 'dire' {Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] indicated he would be willing to back \"regime change\" at a meeting with President { Bush } [ George H.

But Sir { David Manning } [ David Manning ] stressed that Mr { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] told the { President } [ President of the United Kingdom ] he should get { UN } [ United Nations ] support for the move and continued to press for this throughout 2002. According to Sir David, during the { Texas } [ Texas ] meeting, President { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] said there was no \"war plan\" for { Iraq } [ Iraq ] but a \"small cell\" had been set up in { Florida } [ Florida ] to explore options for removing { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ]. Sir David also said { Mr Blair } [ Tony Blair ] asked in June 2002 for military options for the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] joining action against { Iraq } [ Iraq ].Blair 'pledge on regime change'The UK's ambassador to the { UN } [ United Nations ] in the run-up to the war said he believed the invasion was legal but of \"questionable legitimacy\" as it was not backed by the majority of { UN } [ United Nations ] members or possibly even the { British } [ United Kingdom ] public. Sir { Jeremy Greenstock } [ Jeremy Greenstock ] revealed he had not always been kept fully informed of { British } [ United Kingdom ] policy as it developed and had considered resigning at one point. Had weapons inspectors been given more time to do their job, the war could possibly have been prevented, he argued. Sir { Christopher Meyer } [ Christopher Meyer ], the UK's ambassador to the US in the run-up to war, said a day after the meeting Mr { Blair } [ Tony Blair ] mentioned the possibility of regime change publicly for the first time in a speech.Bush 'hardened' Blair { Iraq } [ Iraq ] stanceThe UK received intelligence days before invading { Iraq } [ Iraq ] that { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] may not have been able to use { chemical weapons } [ Chemical weapon ], the inquiry heard. Sir { William Ehrman } [ William Ehrman ], the { Foreign Office } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] {'s } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] director general for defence and intelligence between 2002 and 2004, also said it was a \"surprise\" that no weapons of mass destruction were ever found in { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. Meanwhile, { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] rejected claims from { Lib Dem } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] leader { Nick Clegg } [ Nick Clegg ] that the government could effectively veto aspects of the final report, saying it was up to the inquiry what went into it.Iraq war eve { WMD } [ Weapon of mass destruction ] doubt revealedOn the first day of public hearings {, } [ United States Department of State list of Foreign Affairs Agencies ] four senior diplomats and advisers gave evidence on the war's origins. Sir { Peter Ricketts } [ Peter Ricketts ], a top intelligence official at the time, said the UK government \"distanced itself\" from talk of removing { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] in early 2001. He said it was assumed it was not \"our policy\" despite growing talk in the { US } [ United States ] about the move. Before the hearings began, inquiry chairman { Sir } [ Sir ] { John Chilcot } [ John Chilcot ] said he would not \"shy\" away from criticising individuals in his final report.Inquiry focuses on { Iraq } [ Iraq ] 'threat'Launching the inquiry {, } [ John Chichester, Baron Chichester ] Sir John says he intends to hold as many hearings as possible in public.

And she should be applauded for entering something unusual.Romania - Yet another pared-down set, this time for { Romanian } [ Romania ] artist { Voltaj } [ Voltaj ] with his song De La Capat (All Over Again). The { stage } [ Stage (theatre) ] is scattered with strategically placed suitcases though. Is he hoping to make a quick getaway? But I like the way he chops and changes between { Romanian } [ Romanian language ] and { English } [ English language ] throughout his performance.The song is about supporting { children } [ Child ] whose { parents } [ Parent ] have to leave their homeland to work abroad and he finishes with a message to the audience: \"Don't leave the { children } [ Child ] behind\". Er, I think he might be aiming this at me. Kids, I'll be back from { Vienna } [ Vienna ] on Sunday. Promise.Spain - now this, folks, would be just another ballad if it wasn't for the costume gimmicks! Bring it on! Edurne - { David de Gea } [ David de Gea ]'s girlfriend for the footy fans amongst you - starts off by climbing over a man lying on the stage. Good start. And it gets better. So she's wearing a red evening dress with a { Kylie } [ Kylie Minogue ]-style snood hood that she pushes back before launching into the strong chorus. Well, it worked of { Buck's Fizz } [ Buck's Fizz ] {. } [ Buck's Fizz ]Cyprus - { John Karayiannis } [ John Karayiannis ] says his influences are { Ed Sheeran } [ Ed Sheeran ] and { John Mayer } [ John Mayer ], although to be honest, you wouldn't know it by listening to his { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] entry, { One Thing I Should Have Done } [ One Thing I Should Have Done ]. Personally, I think he sounds more like { Will Young } [ Will Young ] {. } [ Will Young ] This is probably the most traditional { ballad } [ Ballad ] in the contest.It does have quite an old-fashioned feel so maybe that's why the first verse was broadcast in { black } [ Black ] and { white } [ White ] {. } [ White ] Members of the audience wave their obligatory phone torches in time to the music and { John } [ John Lennon ] looks like he's about to cry by the end of the song. Oh dear. John says his eyesight is so bad he can't see further than the end of his nose but he has 9 spare pairs so he should be alright.Australia - This is the perfect antidote to { Cyprus } [ Cyprus ] (no offence but there are a LOT of ballads in this year's contest). This year's wildcard has split opinion in terms of whether it should have been allowed to enter but lighten up people! The { Aussies } [ Australia ] love { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] and this is a really decent pop song from established artist, { Guy Sebastian } [ Guy Sebastian ].We're not quite sure why he's got the { M6 } [ M6 motorway ] backdrop behind him - it's not saying exotic { Gold Coast } [ Gold Coast, Queensland ] to me - but we're loving the jaunty hat and the dancing's not bad either. Tonight Again could land top five.Belgium - Loic Nottet came second in the 2013 Belgium version of { The Voice } [ The Voice (franchise) ] as part of { BJ Scott } [ B. J. Scott ] and this entry, Rhythm Inside, is a bold effort and has more than a touch of { Lorde } [ Lorde ]'s hit { Royals } [ Royals (song) ] about it. Australian artist { Sia } [ Sia (musician) ] recently re-tweeted Loic's version of her hit { Chandelier } [ Chandelier (song) ], which must say something.There's a teetering pirouette in the middle which looks pretty risky plus one of the dancers appears to be doing a floor workout gym-style for some inexplicable reason. {Austria } [ Austria ] - { Conchita } [ Conchita (singer) ] is a hard act to follow and this year's { Austrian } [ Austria ] act has been somewhat in the shadow of the 'Queen of { Austria } [ Austria ]' this week in { Vienna } [ Vienna ]. Rock band The MakeMakes are giving it a good crack with their song We Are Yours!It's pretty low key after the whirlwind that was { Conchita } [ Conchita (band) ] but they certainly haven't disgraced themselves on the big stage in front of a home crowd. And they do all have { facial hair } [ Facial hair ] to keep the { beard } [ Beard ] theme going. And we have another gimmick - woo hoo! The { piano } [ Piano ] is set on fire! Er, health and safety anyone? Where are the { EU } [ European Union ] regulations when you need them? {Greece } [ Greece ] - Phew. They've either put out the { piano } [ Piano ] fire or they've wheeled in another for Maria Elena Kyriacou's  entry, One Last Breath. This is another typical { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] ballad, with a predictable 80s-style drum beat joining in for the second verse.She's got a fine pair of lungs on her though and the wind machine is in full action as she builds up to the finale. Maria Elena co-wrote the song herself. Before winning a { Greek } [ Greece ] talent show, she was a professor so at least that's something to fall back on if the wind doesn't blow in her favour (sorry!) {Armenia } [ Armenia ] - Genealogy, had to change their song title from Don't Deny to Face the Shadow after it was deemed too political by the powers that be with its apparent reference to the mass killings of { Armenians } [ Armenians ] by { Ottoman Turks } [ Ottoman Empire ] 100 years ago. Not quite sure what the point was given the lyrics remain unchanged.But anyway, it's a powerful { rock } [ Rock music ] ballad sung by a six-strong group, featuring { opera } [ Opera ]-style warbling plus your more standard { pop } [ Pop music ] voices. There's some pretty impressive harmonies here, too.Lithuania's upbeat This Time comes from yet another male/female duo, Monika Linkyte and Vaidas Baumila. The song can certainly hold its own and there's a three-second kiss between the pair midway through the performance which seems to go down very well with the audience. There's definitely { chemistry } [ Chemistry ] there.Serbia's entry has the perfect ingredients for a { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] hit. Big diva voice, spooky dancers with masks who strip off to reveal new costumes, reminiscent of { Bucks Fizz } [ Bucks Fizz ], and an \"I am what I am\" message from its plus-size singer, Bojana Stamenov. Beauty Never Lies starts off as a { ballad } [ Ballad ] before building into a classic { Euro } [ Europe ] discobeat { dance } [ Dance music ] track that is sending audiences wild in { Vienna } [ Vienna ].And hats off to the backing vocalists/dancers for presenting the chorus in { sign language } [ Sign language ] while leaping around the stage. This could be a surprise winner.Norway's entry is a real grower and duo Morland and Debrah Scarlett have to be one of the coolest acts in this year's final. Some { songs } [ Song ] don't need { gimmicks } [ Gimmick ] and this is one of them. Their song, A Monster Like Me, is creeping up in the betting odds and it's a really hard one to call - it could be too slow for voters hearing it for the first time and it's not typical { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] fare. Then again, that could work in their favour.Kjetil Morland comes from southern { Norway } [ Norway ] but has spent most of his adult life in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], after moving there to study. This of course explains his very { English } [ England ] accent which threw me off guard in yesterday's press conference. So worth cheering them on along with Electro Velvet if you like the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] connection. (Don't tell anyone but this is my favourite). {Sweden } [ Sweden ] is favourite to win this year's contest with Mans Zelmerlow's Heroes and it's not hard to see why. The { Aviici } [ Aviici ]-style track is being belted out by { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] fans across { Vienna } [ Vienna ] (including on a tram last night on the way back the press centre) but its trump card is the stunning background graphics.The innovative and interactive projections wouldn't look out of place at the { Brits } [ Brit Awards ] or { Grammys } [ Grammy Award ]. Whether the { graphics } [ Graphics ] should be as important a factor as the song itself is a debate that will no doubt rumble on should { Sweden } [ Sweden ] win.Slovenia - This was a slick opening performance from married duo { Marjetka } [ Marjetka ] and { Raay } [ Raay ]. Their act is called Maraaya, a combination of. you've got it, { Marjetka } [ Marjetka ] and { Raay } [ Raay ]. Here For You has a genuine { contemporary } [ Contemporary classical music ] edge with a catchy { chorus } [ Refrain ] that should see it do well tonight. And it can't be easy kicking off a show watched by nearly 200m people on TV.Not sure if the huge { headphones } [ Headphones ] paired with a { wedding dress } [ Wedding dress ] is a good look but anything goes at { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] {. } [ Eurovision Song Contest ]  Their act also features a very energetic { dancer } [ Dance ] playing an imaginary { violin } [ Violin ], plus Raay making love with the { camera } [ Camera ] from his { piano } [ Piano ] seat. Whatever floats your boat.France - Not one act who has been placed second in the line-up at { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] has ever won. So it's a tough ask for { France } [ France ]'s { Lisa Angell } [ Lisa Angell ]. Let's hope her lucky routine is in place - when her daughter is backstage with her, { Lisa } [ Lisa Simpson ] kisses her on the forehead and if she's not there, she keeps a picture of her close by. Bless.Lisa's a fantastic and powerful singer live but I can't see this ballad doing the business, despite the men in uniform flanking her on either side. It's one of the few entries this year to be sung in a native tongue, titled N'oubliez Pas. Or Don't Forget. Sorry { Lisa } [ Lisa (given name) ], we just might.Israel - Golden Boy, { Nadav Guedj } [ Nadav Guedj ], certainly lives up to his name here in the press centre. They absolutely love the 16-year-old bundle of energy who intends to prove he's \"the king of fun\". { For } [ For (song) ] his tender years {, } [ For (song) ] he oozes confidence and totally owns { the } [ The ] stage (I'm channelling my inner { Simon Cowell } [ Simon Cowell ] {). } [ Simon Cowell ]And check out his bling winged gold trainers. His track covers all angles, starting off with a ballad-like solo which morphs into a { Justin Timberlake } [ Justin Timberlake ]-style dance track before it leads into a { Middle Eastern } [ Middle East ]-influenced chorus. Hold on to your hats.Estonia - { Elina Born } [ Elina Born ] and { Stig Rasta } [ Stig Rasta ] certainly have their country behind them - they picked up 79% of the vote from { Estonian } [ Estonia ] TV viewers in the selection contest. Goodbye to Yesterday has some pretty odd lyrics in places (\"I'm all alone, lying here naked waiting by the phone\" for starters). Songwriter { Stig } [ Stig (musician) ] rarely sings himself, he usually just writes for other people. And you can tell.Don't get me wrong, he can hold a tune but { Elina } [ Elina (Italian singer) ] definitely has the stronger voice. However, the song is strong and the pair will be hoping for a second win for { Estonia } [ Estonia ] in { Vienna } [ Vienna ]. The piece de resistance is a clever illusion which sees { Stig } [ Stig (musician) ] \"disappear\" into thin air at the end of the performance. Hurrah, the first real gimmick of the night! {United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] - { Rolling Stones } [ The Rolling Stones ] tribute act singer Alex Larke and vocalist Bianca Nicholas are really enjoying the ride here in { Vienna } [ Vienna ]. Their song, Still In Love With You, has been the subject of much debate on { social media } [ Social media ] and Alex himself has described it as a \" {Marmite } [ Marmite ] {\" song } [ Marmite (song) ] i.e. you either { love } [ Love ] it or { hate } [ Hatred ] it. But it's a fun ditty and in a { Eurovision Song Contest } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] sadly lacking in gimmicks this year, { Electro Velvet } [ Electro Velvet ] {'s } [ Electro Velvet ] performance should stand out.Keep your eye on those costumes, that's all I'm saying. Not to mention { Bianca } [ Bianca James ]'s fabulous hair extensions and some { pyrotechnics } [ Pyrotechnics ] for good measure. Don't forget, { Sandie Shaw } [ Sandie Shaw ] won in { Vienna } [ Vienna ] in 1967 with Puppet On A String. Let's hope it's a good omen.The show is being hosted by three women, { Mirjam Weichselbraun } [ Mirjam Weichselbraun ], { Alice Tumler } [ Alice Tumler ] and Arabella Kiesbauer but { Conchita } [ Conchita Mart\u00ednez ] is clearly the lady of the moment as she pops up out of a podium in a sparkling pink number - and now the 'Queen of { Austria } [ Austria ]' is flying across the stage!All the contestants walk up to the stage surrounded by their respective flags.I'll be giving you my thoughts on each entry.The show is just about to start, and the noise has really ramped up in the last 15 minutes or so. We'll be lucky to hear the performances at this rate!And if you're having a party, get in touch with { Graham Norton } [ Graham Norton ] and he might just give you a shout-out.So hold on tight, here we go.Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more - I've arrived at the press centre and will be here for the duration.Just before leaving the { hotel } [ Hotel ], I saw { Electro Velvet } [ Electro Velvet ] dashing back out, presumably on their way to the { arena } [ Arena ] {. } [ Arena ]And I literally bumped into { Graham Norton } [ Graham Norton ] as I came out of the lift - or should I say, he bumped into me. He looked in a bit of a rush. For your information, the { beard } [ Beard ] is looking well-groomed ahead of the { final } [ Final (competition) ] {. } [ Final (competition) ]On the way to the { arena } [ Arena ], I passed dozens of { fans } [ Fan (person) ] streaming out after the final { dress rehearsal } [ Rehearsal ], soaked to the skin.It's rained pretty much solidly since I arrived - I bet the sun comes out tomorrow just as I board the plane.Flags are flying already inside the { press room } [ Press room ] and elbows are out. A { French } [ France ] radio station has already stuck its label on the { BBC } [ BBC ] {'s } [ BBC ] allocated table. This could be war!On a lighter note, I've just been introduced to Terry Vision - a puppet who is a reporter for unofficial { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] website ESC Insight.Hmmm. Do you think he might be based on someone closer to home with a strong { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] association? {Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] fans, it's the day you've been waiting for - the grand final!It's raining here in { Vienna } [ Vienna ] (just for a change) but that isn't dampening anyone's spirits.I've just spotted Alex from { Electro Velvet } [ Electro Velvet ] in the hotel foyer looking relaxed ahead of the final dress rehearsal this afternoon and the place is swarming with fans - I bumped into several members of one unofficial fan club from { London } [ London ] who did an impromptu dance routine in the hotel reception complete with { LED } [ Light-emitting diode ] light gloves, presumably in honour of { Electro Velvet } [ Electro Velvet ]'s illuminating stage show.Not to mention their specially made { T-shirts } [ T-shirt ] carrying the { slogan } [ Slogan ]: \"Sounding Good, Sugar\", a line from Still In Love With You.The { bookies } [ Bookmaker ]' odds have made interesting reading during the week, with fluctuations aplenty following each semi-final.According to { Oddschecker } [ Oddschecker ] this morning, which compiles all the big bookmakers, { Sweden } [ Sweden ] are still out in front, followed by { Russia } [ Russia ] - who have edged past { Italy } [ Italy ], now lying in third.Belgium and { Australia } [ Australia ] are also in the running.Electro Velvet are somewhere in the middle.But who knows? Last year, it was predicted that the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] would claim a top five place but we ended up coming a disappointing 17th.The { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] experts here in { Vienna } [ Vienna ] have also been sharing their thoughts about how it might go tonight.Paul Jordan, best known as Dr Eurovision, told me: \" {Sweden } [ Sweden ] is one to watch, they usually do well.\"It's not the best song but it's contemporary and his performance is really innovative.\" {Russia } [ Russia ] could do well. Given the wider political context it will be interesting to watch the reaction for this they were booed last year.\"That's unlikely to happen this year, though.According to { The Moscow Times } [ The Moscow Times ], { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] organisers have \"sound-reducing\" technology at the ready to silence the audience should any booing occur this evening.In { Copenhagen } [ Copenhagen ] last year, { Russia } [ Russia ]'s { Tolmachevy Twins } [ Tolmachevy Twins ] were repeatedly booed, although they ended up in seventh place.The pair took the flak for their mother country's stance on { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] and { Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] record on { gay rights } [ LGBT rights by country or territory ] {. } [ LGBT ]We'll find out tonight if { Russia } [ Russia ]'s entry this year, { Polina Gagarina } [ Polina Gagarina ], with her song about tolerance and peace, will suffer the same fate.Just bumped into Kathrin Zechner, director of television at { ORF } [ ORF (broadcaster) ], { Austria } [ Austria ] {'s } [ Austria ] state broadcaster {. } [ Austria ]She was responsible for choosing { Conchita } [ Conchita Mart\u00ednez ] to represent { Austria } [ Austria ] at { last year's contest } [ Eurovision Song Contest 2006 ] and is in charge of the show's production.\"We went for the most challenging and she has a wonderful voice. She is so laidback and wise for her age.\"I told her to present six songs and { Phoenix } [ Phoenix (band) ] just stood out.\"\"Tears, happiness and pride! When they said { Austria } [ Austria ] was in the lead, I nearly fainted!\"\"The theme of the eye is about the vision of life and keeping an eye on the people around you.\"We've put the { green room } [ Green room ] in the middle of the room, so it's really part of the show, as are the { audience } [ Audience ].\"The Building Bridges theme is about diversity, between old and young, women and men, different { races } [ Race (human categorization) ], { sexuality } [ Human sexuality ].\"I'm the only female { director } [ Board of directors ] on my { board } [ Board of directors ], so that's my focus. Men will never give a place to women for free, you really have to push.\"We wanted three { Austrians } [ Austria ] who are multi-lingual, from different { ethnic groups } [ Ethnic group ]. They're all { professionals } [ Professional ] and all working { mums } [ Mother ].\"\"Keep an eye on your neighbour, { Austria } [ Austria ] is a great place to visit and we built the longest, sparkly bridge - to { Australia } [ Australia ] and back!\"We're all a bit bleary-eyed in the press centre this morning after the semi-final last night but thankfully, one of the { BBC } [ BBC ] producers has come armed with { PG Tips } [ PG Tips ] to keep us going. I managed to grab { UK } [ United Kingdom ] hopefuls Electro Velvet for a quick chat ahead of the first dress rehearsal for the final.Bianca: \"We just can't wait to get up there. The { nerves } [ Nerve ] are starting to come a little, but that's a good thing. It just means that you care a lot about it.\"Alex: \"I think we'll be quite pumped on the night, there'll be a lot of adrenaline!\"Bianca: \"All that stuff is totally outside of our control. If you focus on where you're going to come, how you're doing in the odds, it can distract you from the performance which is the most important thing.\"Alex: \"We've put ourselves in our own little bubble, so we're not communicating with the outside world. We're just getting on with making sure our performance is tip top and then hopefully the rest will fall into place.\" {Bianca } [ Bianca James ]:  \"I hope we'll feel on top of the world and feel proud of what we've done wherever we come.\"Alex:  \"There might be a glass of wine!\"Bianca: \"We're quite lucky we're on early so we can then enjoy everyone else's performances. So we'll get to see some of our friends' performances and we're rooting for them, too.\"Alex: \"We did a little stint on the { ukulele } [ Ukulele ] (at last night's semi-final).\"Bianca: \"It's so nice that a complete stranger wants to approach you and wish you good luck. It's really encouraging.\" {Bianca } [ Bianca Bianca ]: \" {Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] is very fan-led, the staging is getting better and better and we're using state-of-the-art technology in our performance, it's just moving with the times.\"More and more fans are descending on the { Austrian } [ Austria ] capital as Grand Final day looms and I caught up with Mike and Louise, a couple from { Nottingham } [ Nottingham ], who are first-timers at { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ].Michael: \"We wanted to come to { Vienna } [ Vienna ] anyway so we thought, 'let's kill two birds with one stone'. We're more festival-goers really, we're off to the { Isle of Wight } [ Isle of Wight ] later this year. { It } [ Information technology ] took us two days to get here because { Louise } [ Louise Thompson ] doesn't fly!Mike:  \"I think { it } [ Information technology ]'s OK, I think { it } [ Information technology ] was wrong to put in the old has-beens - Englebert and Bonnie - in { it } [ Information technology ] {. } [ Information technology ]Louise: \" {Electro Velvet } [ Electro Velvet ] were just put together for this, it's just one record and we might not hear from them again.\"Mike:  \"We went to the first semi-final. Most of the songs were big { ballads } [ Ballad ] or very { poppy } [ Pop music ] and I think { Electro Velvet } [ Electro Velvet ] have been quite clever, it's slightly off-beat.Louise: \"I think the song's catchy.\"Mike:  \"They played it live in the { auditorium } [ Auditorium ] and it came across OK with the { sound system } [ Sound system (Jamaican) ] beefing it up.\"Louise: \"Everyone was cheering. You can never tell!\" {Louise } [ Louise Redknapp ]: \"It's me really! It's always been there since you were young. In the last 8-10 years it's changed again, young people are having parties. In { England } [ England ] we always know we're never going to win. Good bands don't want to be part of it.\"Michael: \"If { Take That } [ Take That ] or { Blur } [ Blur (band) ] entered, they wouldn't win. It's all { political } [ Politics ] {. } [ Political science ]\"Louise: \"I love { Italy } [ Italy ] but having seen { Serbia } [ Serbia ], I think with the lyrics, the big ballad start-off and then the beat, it's got all the ingredients.Michael: The { Australian } [ Australia ] one was good. That's a good { pop } [ Pop music ] song.So we now have the order of the 26 acts in { grand final } [ Grand final ] {. } [ List of Australian rules football Grand Final winners ] The { UK } [ United Kingdom ] is in fifth - Alex from Electro Velvet told me just now he was pleased with the slot, adding that many of the upbeat songs are in the first half. They are sandwiched between a strong track from { Estonia } [ Estonia ] and { Armenia } [ Armenia ]'s moody protest ballad. { France } [ France ] had better start worrying though - no-one who is second in the line-up has ever won { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] {. } [ France ] Here's the list in full.1.Slovenia2.France3.Israel4.Estonia5.United Kingdom6.Armenia7.Lithuania8.Serbia9.Norway10.Sweden11.Cyprus12.Australia13.Belgium14.Austria15.Greece16.Montenegro17.Germany18.Poland19.Latvia20.Romania21.Spain22.Hungary23.Georgia24.Azerbaijan25.Russia26.Albania27.ItalyAnd breathe.The biggest cheers went up in the press room for performances from { Azerbijian } [ Azerbaijan ], { Montenegro } [ Montenegro ], { Slovenia } [ Slovenia ], { Israel } [ Israel ], { Norway } [ Norway ] and { Sweden } [ Sweden ] during the second semi-final - and that was reflected in the vote tonight, as they all went through.They were joined by { Lithuania } [ Lithuania ], { Poland } [ Poland ] - which seemed to be something of a surprise to some - { Cyprus } [ Cyprus ] and { Latvia } [ Latvia ].Everyone held their breath as they waited for the last act to land a place in the final -  and it went to { Israel } [ Israel ]'s 16-year-old Nadav Guedj.Sadly, the other 16-year-olds in the competition - { San Marino } [ San Marino ] duo Michele Perniola and Anita Simoncini - will not be joining him.Multiple-Eurovision winner { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] also missed the cut, as did { Malta } [ Malta ], { Portugal } [ Portugal ], the { Czech Republic } [ Czech Republic ], { Switzerland } [ Switzerland ] and { Iceland } [ Iceland ]. It's 20 years now since their run of incredible { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] glory was halted and for the second year in a row, they didn't make the final.\"The poor { Czechs } [ Czech Republic national football team ] were bounced out again and they are yet to ever appear on the final stage. { San Marino } [ San Marino ] of course disappointed and the youngest singers in the contest couldn't capitalise on their experience in the junior event last year.\"So who is responsible for the outcome?Viewers at home were able to vote in the semi-final if their country was performing in it. The { UK } [ United Kingdom ] are one of the \"Big Five\" who will go straight through to the final but { Brits } [ United Kingdom ] were allowed to vote on Thursday night.The public determined half of the vote and the other half was down to the national juries of all the countries taking part or allocated to the semi-final.As the results came through, the betting odds online began frantically changing before my eyes as we finally knew for definite who would be singing on Saturday night.Russia, { Belgium } [ Belgium national football team ] and { Serbia } [ Serbia national football team ] are looking good while { Sweden } [ Sweden national football team ] and { Italy } [ Italy national football team ] are still the favourites. { Australia } [ Australia ], { Estonia } [ Estonia ], and now { Norway } [ Norway ], could also be in the running.There was a jubilant atmosphere at the { press conference } [ News conference ] that followed the show - the losers and their supporters must have sneaked out the back.I think I was the only { Brit } [ United Kingdom ] among a sea of excitable { Israelis } [ Israel ] surrounding me on all sides of the seating area, and it wasn't long before they broke into a spontaneous rendition of { Guedj } [ Yasser Guedj ]'s { Golden Boy } [ Golden Boy (song) ]. {Poland } [ Poland ]'s entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through. She was in a { rock } [ Rock music ] { pop } [ Pop music ] band who were involved in a serious { car accident } [ Traffic collision ] in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down.\"I feel I've got something to say, a message to put in my songs. Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event. I always look on the bright side, that's why I'm here.\" {Sweden } [ Sweden ]'s { Mans Zelmerlow } [ Mans Zelmerlow ] said he was feeling \"happy and relieved\" after going through  before admitting, \"I could have done some things better tonight. I was a bit rushed in the second verse, so I hope I'll be in the running to be champ!\"Don't worry Mans, you have three dress rehearsals before the big event to make it perfect.There's a frisson in the air today in the { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] press centre as the ' {Austrian } [ Austria ] Queen', aka { Conchita } [ Conchita Mart\u00ednez ], is in the house.Her press conference was crammed to the gills with journos and { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] superfan bloggers. She didn't disappoint, entering the room wearing a { dress } [ Dress ] slit to the { waist } [ Waist ] to the strains of her single { You Are Unstoppable } [ You Are Unstoppable ] {. } [ You Are Unstoppable ]What's it like hosting the green room at the semi-finals, ahead of Saturday's grand final?\"Three days ago I thought: 'Why would I agree on doing this? Last year, the last thing I wanted was for anyone to ask me how I felt! But I really do enjoy it, it's a new experience. I'm pushing my boundaries - I have just one minute and 48 seconds for each contestant.\"How have you dealt with the fame that came with your win last year?\"I'm still not used to being a known person outside { Austria } [ Austria ]. It's something I really appreciate.\"And you've written a book about your life already!\"I'm just 26, it was too early to write my memoirs - there weren't that many! But then we came up with a concept that everyone liked, a book that I myself would like - with many pictures!\"Midway through proceedings, the MD of Sony Records in { Austria } [ Austria ] surprised { Conchita } [ Conchita Mart\u00ednez ] with a platinum award for her self-titled album.Conchita: \"What are you doing here?

Crowds had gathered and the stage was set for the \"Big Five\" contestants ( {France } [ France ], { Italy } [ Italy ], the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], { Germany } [ Germany ], { Spain } [ Spain ]) plus wildcard { Australia } [ Australia ] to prove themselves ahead of Saturday's grand final.The square was packed with fans from across the continent and beyond, despite the heavy rain which decided to make an appearance just as the bizarre warm-up acts - lindy hop and { flamenco } [ Flamenco ] dancers anyone? - got going.Guy Sebastian was first up, receiving a raucous welcome, not least from a substantial group of { Aussies } [ Australian Australians ] who clearly felt it was worth the air fare and 24-hour flight to join the party.\"You guys are awesome for staying in the rain. We love { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] in { Australia } [ Australia ]  and we are super-excited to be taking part.\" {Guy } [ Guy Ritchie ] chose to perform an { acoustic } [ Acoustic music ] rendition of { Tonight Again } [ Tonight Again ] {, } [ Tonight Again ] saying he wanted to save the full show for Saturday.French contestant { Lisa Angell } [ Lisa Angell ] was up next, with one of the few Eurovision entries this year not to be sung in { English } [ English language ], N'oubliez Pas (that's \"Don't Forget\" to me and you).So does she want to win? \"If I want something, I want something,\" she said. \"If I want { bread } [ Bread ], I want { bread } [ Bread ], if I want { cheese } [ Cheese ], I want { cheese } [ Cheese ], so if I want to win, I want to win.\" Er, ok.It was soon time for the { Brits } [ United Kingdom ] to cheer as Electro Velvet - { Alex Larke } [ Alex Larke ] and { Bianca Nicholas } [ Bianca Nicholas ] - arrived, complete with the obligatory apology from Alex for \"bringing the weather with us\".With the { rain } [ Rain ] now streaming down, the lyrics \"Don't go out in the pouring { rain } [ Rain ] / You might get wet, I'd be upset\" seemed just a little { ironic } [ Irony ] {. } [ Irony ]For some reason, { Germany } [ Germany ]'s { Ann Sophie } [ Ann Sophie ] wasn't present so we had to make do with the video that accompanies her track, Black Smoke.Italy and { Spain } [ Spain ] rounded off the evening, with { Italian } [ Italy ] trio { Il Volo } [ Il Volo ] belting out their { Il Divo } [ Il Divo ]-esque Grand Amore. It got the biggest ovation of the night and many here believe it's a serious contender for the { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] crown.Spain's { Edurne } [ Edurne ] then belted out her gutsy number Amanecer as the rain finally cleared up and the crowds began to disperse.So I've made it into the frankly massive { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] press centre - 800 square metres with 800 separate work spaces.A dress rehearsal for tomorrow night's second semi-final is just about to begin. Nerves are jangling, as the elimination of { PKN } [ PKN (TV series) ] at last night's show proved no-one is safe.The { rehearsal } [ Rehearsal ] is being beamed across the { press centre } [ Newsroom ] on giant screens but, sadly, I'm not allowed to give you any updates - none of the { rehearsals } [ Rehearsal ] can be reported on.Meanwhile, { Vienna } [ Vienna ] itself has gone { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] crazy. The city's Madame Tussaud's now has a wax figure of last year's winner, Conchita Wurst, and there's even a display in the Leopold Museum titled Nul-Pointers.The { exhibition } [ Exhibition ] contains - you guessed it - a portrait of each of the 34 { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] participants whose performances did not earn them a single point.Talk about a back-handed compliment.Earlier, I spotted my first { gay } [ Gay ]-themed pedestrian { traffic light } [ Traffic light ] (see above). They were due to be removed in June but Maria Vassilakou, in charge of traffic issues in the local council, has said they will now remain.Right, it's time for me to hop off to the Euro Village to see the \"Big Five\" performing. I'll report back later.Malta's enigmatic singer { Amber } [ Amber (singer) ] has been spreading the { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] message of peace and equality ahead of her performance at the second semi-final on Thursday.Yesterday, she was seen sporting a \"Yes\" badge when she met { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ]'s Molly Sterling in { Vienna } [ Vienna ], to show her support for the marriage equality referendum - which takes place on Friday in { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ]. It's the world's first { referendum } [ Referendum ] on { same sex marriage } [ Same-sex marriage ] and is, of course, being closely followed by the many { gay } [ Gay ] fans of { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ].Earlier today, Amber was spotted at { Vienna } [ Vienna ]'s Learning Cafe, a free service for kids and teenagers from { refugee } [ Refugee ] families.Amber plans to become a { primary school } [ Primary school ] teacher after { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ], so at least she has something to fall back on should her song, { Warrior } [ Warrior (Amber song) ], not make it through to the grand final.Press accreditation sorted, with much excitement surrounding the goody bags handed out to { journalists } [ Journalist ] - { salami } [ Salami ], { sausages } [ Sausage ], you name it.

As one of the \"Big Five\" which contribute the most money to the { European Broadcasting Union } [ European Broadcasting Union ] - along with { Italy } [ Italy ], { Spain } [ Spain ], { France } [ France ] and { Germany } [ Germany ] - the UK goes through automatically.

Can you take us back to the moment when you had the first phone call asking you to chair the inquiry and what did you think?JC: The first phone call came on a Friday evening. I was at home in { Devon } [ Devon ] and - and the { cabinet secretary } [ Cabinet secretary ] {'s } [ Secretary of State for the Environment ] private secretary came on to say (clears throat) he wants an urgent word. I said, 'well, I'm here.' 'No, no, no. He wants an urgent word first thing on Monday morning.' I was still there on Monday morning, the { cabinet secretary } [ Cabinet secretary ] telephoned and said, 'there's going to be an announcement this morning that there's to be an { Iraq } [ Iraq ] inquiry. Are you going to chair it?' I said, 'well I'd quite like to think about and the terms of reference and the membership and procedures.' 'Well, I can give you about eight minutes.'LK: Eight minutes?JC: Yes or no. I said, 'give me a minute.' And then I said yes.LK: Why did you say yes?JC: Because I was asked to do it. I'd been involved in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] through the { Butler Inquiry } [ Butler Inquiry ], I knew some of the stuff, the government was pledged and { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] had accepted there was to be one. I thought lots of people could do it. But I knew that I could do it in a way that would not be the same as other inquiries which had proved problematic, frankly, in their procedure. So.LK: What was the difference then?JC: I was really clear from the outset, even before the { Parliamentary } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] statement by { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] on the Monday, that it shouldn't be an accusatory inquiry, it should be an inquiry into the facts, the history, in effect. That had consequences. Because the - I had no part, of course, in discussions in the { Cabinet Office } [ Cabinet Office (United Kingdom) ] with { ministers } [ Minister (government) ] and { officials } [ Official ] about how long it might take. They took the view it might be a year or a bit more, but they were basing that on the assumption that it would be a private inquiry on paper with no public hearings or anything of that character. Like the { Falklands Inquiry } [ Falklands Inquiry ] had been in 1984. I knew right from the outset, by instinct and then by parliamentary discussion, press commentary and the rest, certainly the families that was not going to work. It was going to have to have hearings and it would imply then that it would take longer. I didn't - no idea how long.LK: You had no idea how long?JC: No. And I - very sad, I do need to get a reference and mention it here for { Martin Gilbert } [ Martin Gilbert ]. Apart from him dying sadly part-way through, all the colleagues stuck with it, and so did the - the secretary to the inquiry. I won't say we didn't get a bit impatient at moments, but there it was.LK: Why did it take so long?JC: Because there was so much stuff. It was a history of, in effect, starting in 2001, of eight to nine years of { diplomatic } [ Diplomacy ], { military } [ Military ], { political } [ Politics ] resource, every sort of aspect. And I felt very sorry for the families, I really did, and we kept in touch with them as best we could. Some said that's okay, some said, you know. And the { lawyers } [ Lawyer ] were involved, and their { lawyers } [ Lawyer ]. Which slows things down when you try and get into a relationship. But one of the other features which, I think, contributed both to duration, but also to process, was an instinctive feeling which all my colleagues shared, that we didn't want an accusatory inquiry so we didn't want legal representation. Gordon { Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] actually wanted us to administer an { oath } [ Oath ] {. } [ Oath ] I took a bit of legal advice, said, 'no, I'm not going to do that, because if we do witnesses are exposed to a possible charge of perjury. Then they have to have { legal } [ Law ] representation, { QCs } [ Qualifications and Credit Causation Committee ] on both sides.' And I thought oh, poor { Lord Saville } [ Robert Saville, 2nd Baron Saville ], { Bloody Sunday } [ Bloody Sunday (1937) ], 200 million { quid } [ Quid ].LK: So { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ] wanted you to take evidence from people under oath?JC: He said, 'think - please consider very carefully, can you or will you?' I said, 'no, but we'll introduce a - an informal procedure where I'd be asking each witness, you know, 'will you stand by what you say because we will then compare it later to the written record, and so be careful.' And they all agreed.LK: Why do you think he wanted you to take evidence under oath?JC: Oh, { belt } [ Belt (clothing) ] and { braces } [ Suspenders ] {. } [ Suspenders ] Made sure the truth came out. I'm not so sure. I don't know actually. I think he just felt in procedural terms it was sort of stronger. Well, there it was.LK: And you say you were against that idea because you were worried about people having to perjure themselves?JC: Not having to, but by exposing them to the risk. If you take an { oath } [ Oath ] you are open to a charge of { perjury } [ Perjury ] if the { documentary } [ Documentary film ] record, for example, shows that you didn't tell the truth. In that situation every { witness } [ Witness ] is entitled to a { lawyer } [ Lawyer ] to represent them. That destroys the { dialogue } [ Dialogue ] {. } [ Dialogue ] And what we wanted, frankly, was to get the story. And I have got a - collateral - for this for argument. Because { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ], when the first attempt at a { Falklands } [ Falkland Islands ]-style inquiry failed politically.LK: To hold it in private?JC: Yeah. He said, 'well, John, why don't you go round all the heads of the relevant { select committees } [ Select committee ] and the leaders of { political parties } [ Political party ] and see what they want?' And pretty much without exception they all said, 'we want to know all that happened and the evidence behind it.' They didn't say, 'we want to find the guilty party.' So I followed their guidance. But for a long time.LK: Did you - did you have any idea at the start how complicated and controversial it would become?JC: Controversy yes, because it had begun as a very controversial piece of statecraft. Complex, I think I probably underestimated it. There were so many dimensions and facets. Some of them were extremely interesting. I learnt a great deal, in those years. As, for example, the difficulty of finding out how many people die in a { civil war } [ Civil war ] or something approaching a { civil war } [ Civil war ]. Because you've got { hospital } [ Hospital ] records but lots of people are just { buried } [ Burial ] in the ground or blown up, whatever. It's very hard to estimate. And the estimate range was huge. It's not a pleasant subject but it's interesting.LK: Did the inquiry get too big do you think?JC: In the sense of too large an army of staff and committee members, certainly not. I think we were very sparse. In terms of range and scale there were two propositions put to us: one was we should do an interim inquiry up to but short of the { invasion } [ Invasion ], or perhaps including the { invasion } [ Invasion ] but leave the rest for another tier of report. One or two of the { committee } [ Committee ] saw attraction in that. I have to claim I was opposed and so were others. On the footing that it was already apparent that one of the great failings of this enterprise was the lack of preparation and thought beforehand, which then spills over into the aftermath, and how do you read back if you've already published what you said about the run-up? It just doesn't make historical sense. The other was, could you pair off whole areas of subject matter? The treatment of { civilians } [ Civilian ] {, } [ Prisoner of war ] for example {, } [ Prisoner of war ] increasingly it became too difficult just to - you don't go down every rabbit hole. You can't do that. But when there's a sort of quite wide rabbit hole, it might even be a badger sett, you - you've got to do down it. Partly because people keep giving evidence and raise topics. International { law } [ Law ] is a classic case. Do you want me to go into that?LK: So you had to pursue the { evidence } [ Evidence ], you had to follow the { evidence } [ Evidence ] where it took you?JC: Yes.LK: But did you also get frustrated by the length of time it took, because of course not everything was in your control?JC: I don't admit to frustration. I don't even admit to { fatigue } [ Fatigue ] {. } [ Fatigue ] It was very stimulating. I was - as I said earlier, I was sorry for the families in particular, but also that politically there was a risk that the impact of it would fade. I don't believe myself that happened, but that's a judgement for others.JC: Yes.LK: People who were to be criticised were given a right to reply beforehand. Was that the right thing to do?JC: I hesitate to use the phrase, 'the right thing to do,' because it has echoes of other people using it. Was it necessary? Yes, I believe it was, for reasons of underlying fairness. If you're going to deprive witnesses of the opportunity to have legal representation during a live session, or indeed in representing their case, you have to find some other way of rectifying the potential unfairness. Now, there's a history to { Maxwell } [ James Maxwell ], as lots of people know, and you go right back to the { Salmon } [ Salmon ] principles, and { Maxwell } [ James Maxwell ] of course was a  - it was a business inquiry about fitness to be a director. There are those, including my very revered friend of very long standing, { Louis Blom-Cooper } [ Louis Blom-Cooper ], who says you didn't have to do that. You can do it without being unfair. To which my reply is you can only do it without being unfair if you give legal representation.LK: Did that process, though, lead to you having to change some of the criticisms that you would put forward?JC: Well, that's one way to ask the question.  What it did do was I think it produced some new evidence which we'd not been made aware of, because we had the whole of the { government } [ Government ] archive, and you can't index a { government } [ Government ] archive 100 {%. } [ Percentage ] So there were bits of { evidence } [ Evidence ] which were helpful. Others which actually pointed to new directions for us to re-explore. So to that extent did it change our ultimate opinions, judgements, not the basic ones, no. It was of course a confidential process, so I'm even at this stage not saying who was involved and what they argued. Did it have a positive effect? To a degree. I still think it satisfied the fairness criteria. But the other thing it did was avoid the delay question, which I don't know that people accept. We set for those often very senior { politicians } [ Politician ] and { military } [ Military ] and other people, quite strict deadlines to respond to often very substantial bodies of { draft } [ Draft (law) ] material. And they all held to them, they didn't string it out. Which - well, I think I was slightly surprised actually.LK: And there was suspicion among the public at the time?JC: Oh yes.LK: That some of the key witnesses, senior { military } [ Military ] figures, senior { politicians } [ Politician ] were trying to water down the criticisms that you wanted to make of them.JC: They were entitled to make their own argument on fairness grounds. But I don't think the report that came out suffers from dilution.LK: But did some of them - and I know you can't identify them -JC: Yeah.LK: But did some of them try to water down the criticisms that you were making of them?JC: I think the fair answer to that is no. They would make the best of their own case. They're entitled to.LK: Isn't that the same thing?JC: No, it's not the same thing actually. It's not to say 'if you avoid that word in that sentence of the draft, I think it would suit me.' There was none of that kind of argument. There were serious arguments about - and I'll take legal argument as one category - where you can have quite an extended dialogue and come out at the end with a revised draft which is not dilute but is more informative or better informed.LK: So a different account?JC: Yes. But I do deny dilution. And anyway, if you look at that report, it's not dilute.LK: Did you find it frustrating then during that period? Because for a long time you were right in the middle of a row about this, with very few opportunities -JC: Yes.LK - to put your side of the story.JC: Yeah. But I think by the time we launched it, it had satisfied their need for - I avoid the word 'closure', but for an account that satisfied their wish to know all that happened and why it happened and by whom.LK: And { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ], he did pressure you to try and hurry up?JC: (speaking over) Yes, he did.LK: How did that play out? What did he say to you? What was the form of those discussions?JC: Essentially messages via the { cabinet secretary } [ Cabinet secretary ] or senior { Cabinet Office } [ Cabinet Office ] staff, and then eventually public correspondence. Which I had no difficulty in replying to politely. Firmness and politeness are different things.LK: Why do you think he was trying to do it?JC: Oh, I think you would need to ask him. But there was some { media } [ Mass media ] interest from some of the papers. The { Guardian } [ The Guardian ] is still using the larger format, but others are not.LK: Did some of the delays with Maxwellisation, and of course the nature of the evidence you were dealing with, a lot of the fact that it had to take so long was because of course, of the nature of what you were asking.JC: Yes.LK: And the nature of the witness sessions and the rest. Do you feel that the { politicians } [ Politician ] you dealt with were as straight with you as they ought to have been?JC: I think I'd need to distinguish. They adopted different approaches. And I have to name names here because these were public sessions. He makes the most persuasive case he can. Not departing from the { truth } [ Truth ] but { persuasion } [ Persuasion ] is { everything } [ Everything ]. Advocacy for my position, my Blair position. Jack Straw, on the other hand is much more the { historian } [ Historian ] {. } [ Historian ] And produced, I mean, not only vast amounts of written material, but really stuck to his memory and recall of the key facts as they recurred to him in - under questioning. Others, it was - it varied. You would expect a { lawyer } [ Lawyer ] to make { legal } [ Law ] argument.LK: And they were, particularly the sessions with { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {, } [ Tony Blair ] they were extraordinarily tense.JC: Yes.LK: You say he always tried to make the most persuasive case, the advocate's case.JC: Yes.LK: Do you feel he was as straight with you as he ought to have been?JC: I think I'd have to take us back into the body of the report itself, and the critique that we made. There is, I argued, you know, including in the launch statement, the responsibility on the leading { politician } [ Politician ], of a { government } [ Government ], both to make the case for the policy decision taken but also to balance that with realism about risks, downsides, counter-arguments. If you act simply as a one-sided { advocate } [ Advocate ] you risk losing that. And I think that { risk } [ Risk ] did come - come about.JC: Yes.LK: He gave it a certainty that wasn't justified. I mean that's another way of saying it was exaggerated.JC: He found - I don't know whether consciously or not - a verbal formula in the dossier and his foreword to it. He said - and used it again later. 'I believe the assessed { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] shows beyond doubt.' Pinning it on 'my belief'. Not on the fact, what the assessed intelligence said. You can make an argument around that, both { ethical } [ Ethics ] and - well, there is an { ethical } [ Ethics ] argument I think.LK: Do you think it was { ethical } [ Ethics ] to do that?JC: We criticised it and said it shouldn't have been done.LK: But was it { ethical } [ Ethics ]?JC: I don't know that I - I'm not an { ethicist } [ Ethicist ]. (laugh)LK: But you spent years studying this -JC: Yes. The way you put it in the report and what you've just said would suggest that's somebody who's spent their life in { government } [ Government ], in { public service } [ Public service ].JC: Yes.LK: That you feel he manipulated the evidence to make his own case.JC: Again I'm declining the word 'manipulate'. Using as best he could. But it's only fair to him to say that on the very eve of the invasion he asked the then chair of the { Joint Intelligence Committee } [ Joint Intelligence Committee of the United States Congress ], can you tell me beyond any reasonable doubt that { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] has { weapons of mass destruction } [ Weapon of mass destruction ]. To which the answer was, yes I can. He was entitled to rely on that. { But } [ But (song) ] would it have been wise to rely on it? {LK } [ LK (song) ]: And when it came to his evidence to you - {JC } [ JC (song) ]: Yes.LK: Do you feel he gave you the fullest version of events?JC: I think he gave an - what was - I hesitate to say this, rather, but I think it was, from his perspective and standpoint, emotionally truthful and I think that came out also in his press conference after the launch statement.   I think he was under - as you said just now - very great emotional pressure during those sessions. Far more than the { committee } [ Committee ] were. He was suffering. He was deeply engaged.  Now in that state of mind and mood you fall back on your instinctive skills and reactions, I think.LK: But he was relying, you suggest, therefore on { emotion } [ Emotion ], not { fact } [ Fact ]?JC:  Both. I mean { fact } [ Fact ], insofar as there are { facts } [ Fact ] particularly in the { intelligence } [ Intelligence ] sphere. Nobody should be allowed to become a senior { minister } [ Minister (government) ] reading { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] without undergoing a { training } [ Training ] course. That was a diversion, but it's also true.LK: But just having been part of those incredibly intense sessions and then having studied that version of events along with the enormous array of documentary evidence that you had, just in the most simple terms, do you believe that { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ]  was as straight with you and the public as he ought to have been?(long pause)JC: Can I slightly reword that to say I think any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] instance.LK: In your view was it a necessary war? I mean you say plainly in the report the peaceful options had not been exhausted.JC: Indeed. To that extent it doesn't satisfy the last resort criteria to that extent. Not necessarily for the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] to join. I leave the { Americans } [ United States ] to make their own argument.LK: If it was therefore unnecessary, do you feel that the { politicians } [ Politician ] who made those decisions for our country ought to bear some greater responsibility? Now you very clearly did not have a legal power in your inquiry, but you probably amassed more evidence than any kind of legal case ever would. Is there a case, do you think, for { politicians } [ Politician ] involved to face some kind of further test, to face the { law } [ Law ]?JC: I can't think what it would be.  So it won't happen that way. If it's not a court internationally recognised you haven't got an authoritative verdict as an outcome, so other than reputational damage, what's involved? I take a more nuanced position, if I'm allowed to, which is that it could have become a necessary war had the intelligence proved to be more reliable than it proved to be. But later - and in effect it's the { Colin Powell } [ Colin Powell ] position. Don't exclude { war } [ War ], but don't do it yet, it's not necessary yet.  It could even be - I hesitate to take in vain the name of a distinguished { French } [ France ] president - but it is even the { Chirac } [ Jacques Chirac ] position. At least on paper.LK: And that's one of the things you go through, the whole dynamic as { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { US } [ United States ] were trying to get { France } [ France ] into their place and they were pushing back in that other way. But for you therefore it was the rush to the conflict?JC: Indeed, and it has so many and quite profound implications. The lack of { preparation } [ Preparation (principle) ], the lack of { risk } [ Risk ] { analysis } [ Analysis ]. The lack of { resource allocation } [ Resource allocation ] {. } [ Resource allocation ] Mistaken models I take - one thing very close to my heart 'cause of my earlier life in the { Home Office } [ Home Office ] and elsewhere and { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ], was the failure of security sector reform. And the notion that { British } [ United Kingdom ] civil policemen, largely unarmed, could enter into a conflict zone and be effective. I mean that's just loony. The { Italian } [ Italy ] { carabinieri } [ Carabinieri ] were very good.LK: Whose fault was that? But whose fault was that? I mean when you read through the information in the report, particularly about preparation, it's astonishing. Whose fault was it? Because it must have been somebody's fault.JC: The critique that we mount and mounted, and I still stand by, was that a { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] at the head of the { government } [ Government ] of a large { country } [ Country ] can't be expected to run a { war } [ War ] on his/her own. If you look at the { Second World War } [ World War II ] you have people like { John Anderson } [ John Anderson, Baron Anderson of Wirral ] fulfilling the civil side of government and { Attlee } [ Clement Attlee ] signally in the new biography by { John Bew } [ John Bew ] - and { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ], the prime minister of the time should, could not, have done it all himself with a tiny { Number 10 } [ 10 Downing Street ] staff. What we say he could and should have done was appoint a very senior non-departmental minister to run the show and coordinate otherwise very senior ministers - { defence } [ Defence minister ], { Foreign Office } [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] and pull it together. And the fact is there was no - I think we used the rather idiomatic term - there was no buy-in by all the different departments and arms of government. And that should have been pulled together and it wasn't. And to do that you need a lot of political clout. I'm not going to cast that particular role in { 2002 } [ 2002 in film ]-3, but there's a good parlour game.LK: Do you think though that because of the lack of preparation, because of your view that it was not at that stage a necessary war.JC: Yeah.LK: Does that mean then the { British } [ United Kingdom ] government put { British } [ United Kingdom ] servicemen and women and { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] civilians in harm's way unnecessarily?JC: In harm's way, certainly. It might have become necessary at a later point, and you can't of course run an exercise like { Iraq } [ Iraq ] whenever you do it without { civilians } [ Civilian ] being unavoidably profoundly affected.  We - I think I have to stick with - it was not necessary for us to join in that at the time we did.LK: And of course { America } [ United States ]'s intentions were plain to see at that point. But having studied it in such detail, seeing for the first time before any of us, those notes, those intimate notes between { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] and { George W Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ], do you think the relationship between the { US } [ United States ] and the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] at that stage was appropriate? Was the relationship between the prime minister and the president appropriate?JC:  There are several things I'd like to say about that. One is I think that the fundamental { British } [ United Kingdom ] strategy was fractured, because our formal policy, right up to the autumn of 2002 was one of { containment } [ Containment ] {. } [ Containment ] That was the concluded decision of { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ].   But the { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] was running one of coercive diplomacy. With the knowledge and support of the { foreign secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ], but the { foreign secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] hoped that { diplomacy } [ Diplomacy ] would win and not { coercion } [ Coercion ]. I think the { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] it probably looked the other way round. So, I think what is harder for I suppose someone who's lived a life in { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ] to understand is the fact that other members of the { cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ], including quite senior members, did not raise any kind of challenge to this - it was pretty plain policy was going two different ways  - sort it  somebody. And that kind of pressure was never really exerted except by { Robin Cook } [ Robin Cook (footballer) ] who does deserve real credit not only because it's with hindsight now. The other things I wanted to say about that were - the official machine, it did put up good and relevant advice at various points, one of which was, shortly before the invasion, look, you've got to have a proper war cabinet setup.  We've always had one, we need it. No. Advice formally went from recall from both the { cabinet secretary } [ Cabinet secretary ] and { David Manning } [ David Manning (politician) ] {. } [ David Manning (politician) ] You need a senior ministerial level committee running it and then an official one to take down the policy intent of the politicians and he'd give it effect in { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ]. To which the { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] said, 'you can play your games as officials, do what you like, but I'm not having a ministerial committee.' And I think it's well known why.LK: Because he didn't want the challenge? He didn't want the scrutiny? He didn't want people to stop him doing what he wanted?JC: I think that's the broader interpretation and the other is, could it be kept from leaking and would there be dissent by certain other members of that potential committee.LK: So it was clear to you that { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] was running his own game with { George Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ], while the rest of the government -JC: Yes.LK: - apart from one or two people didn't know what was going on?JC: That was the fact of the matter. The really quite damaging effect of that however was to give at every level, in the { military } [ Military ] and in { civil } [ Civilian ] { government } [ Government ], the opportunities to shove up any difficult issue they couldn't resolve with the { Americans } [ United States ] at their level. Well it had better go up to the { president } [ President (government title) ]/prime minister. Which I mean is hopeless. You can't clog up that relationship with literally hundreds of difficult decisions. You've got to work right through a { system } [ System ] {. } [ System ] Now the { American } [ United States ] system was quite fractured, of course, between { Rumsfeld } [ Erwin Rumsfeld ] and { Cheney } [ Dick Cheney ] on the one side and { Colin Powell } [ Colin Powell ] on the other. But leave them to their problems. So was ours.  It was also upside down. I've got a rhetorical point to make but it's a real one. { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] made much of, at various points and still does I think, of the need to exert influence on { American } [ United States ] policy making.' For what purpose? To get them to alter their policy? Of course not. So in effect it was a { passive } [ Passive strategy ] { strategy } [ Strategy ] {. } [ Strategy ] Just go along.LK: Do you think he was almost played by the { Americans } [ United States ] then?JC: I think you would need to have a two nation inquiry to get to that.LK: If you're not doing much these days, you're officially retired, there you go.JC: But it is a possible interpretation. We certainly concluded that the amount of effective influence exerted was very slight and short lived. Clearly getting { George Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] to go to the { United Nations } [ United Nations ] in September '02, but that only lasted two/three months. When it comes to the immediate post-invasion era it's pretty much zilch. Whether in terms of de-Baathification or disbanding the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army without money or whatever but with their guns, in all sorts of ways. And then the situation reverses in 2006-7 when in the light of the security failure the { Americans } [ United States ] mount the surge and we're trying to get out.LK: When you saw some of the most notable documents that emerged -JC: Yes.LK: And I'm thinking of course of the note.JC: Of course. 'I shall be with you whatever.'LK: What did you think when you saw that for the first time?JC: I thought exactly the same as { David Manning } [ David Manning (journalist) ] and { Jonathan Powell } [ Jonathan Powell (journalist) ] thought.LK: Which was?JC: You mustn't say that!LK: Because?JC: Because you're giving away far too much. You're making a binding commitment by one { sovereign } [ Sovereignty ] { government } [ Government ] to another which you can't fulfil. You're not in a  position to fulfil it.  I mean he didn't even know the legal position at that point.LK: And on the legal position, I mean you weren't constituted to set up to adjudicate on whether the war was illegal or not.JC: No.LK: But you do make the point, very clearly, in very polite yet quite damning terms, that the ways in which the legal decisions were taken were far from satisfactory.  What did you mean by that?JC:  I suppose if you take it right to the sharpest point the attorney general, { Lord Goldsmith } [ Robert Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith ], was able by middle of February to say that I think there is not only a reasonable argument you can make, it might not prevail but you can make a reasonable argument, that was early February. Then under some pressure, I think the better view is that { Resolution } [ United Nations Security Council resolution ] { 1441 } [ United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 ] by itself without further { resolutions } [ United Nations Security Council resolution ] could sustain the argument of { legality } [ Legality ]. His legal secretary writes to the { prime minister } [ Prime minister ]'s foreign affairs secretary at that moment and says, 'there needs to be very strong evidence that { Saddam } [ Saddam Hussein ] is in continuing breach,' and what happened? The { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] takes no advice from anyone as to the strength or quality of the supporting evidence. Doesn't discuss it with any colleague and simply instructs the private secretary, write back, say it's fine. Now that is perfunctory to an absurd degree. So failure of { process } [ Process (engineering) ] - and for me that's very striking. I don't particularly want to pursue the ins and outs of the legal arguments up to that point, but at that moment I think there was a real failure of responsibility.LK: So whether the { legal } [ Law ] arguments meant that it was okay or not, the ways which those decisions were reached -JC: Yes.LK: - fell significantly short in your view?JC: I think that's a euphemism.LK: Having studied the aftermath, as you did, do you think fundamentally that { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] involvement in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] has made the middle east and therefore by extension our country {, } [ United Kingdom ] less stable, more dangerous?JC: I always hesitate to reach these broad judgements, particularly on affairs which I haven't studied myself. However, I think it is necessary to say that the security failure in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] - both { Iraq } [ Iraq ] as a whole and in the south east where we took responsibility - I'd like to make a point about that too - can only have disrupted not only { Iraq } [ Iraq ] itself but the whole balance of power - { Iran } [ Iran ], { Iraq } [ Iraq ], the Gulf States, the rest, and indirectly { Syria } [ Syria ]. { Libya } [ Libya ] is a possible exception up till much later. But what I do think is that the failure of { security } [ Security ] was staring people in the face from very early on. Certainly from the { autumn } [ Autumn ] of { 2003 } [ 2003 in film ] {. } [ 2003 in film ] By the very latest at the end of 2003. And far too little was done about it.  Now could anything useful have been done about it? You could have poured in more resources, you could have confined your activity, you could have put more weight on the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] political community. But nothing happened until it was frankly too late. And I go back one to the pre and post invasion connection. We started off offering the { Americans } [ United States ] a large scale force of a divisional headquarters and one armoured { brigade } [ Brigade ] to go in through the north of { Iraq } [ Iraq ]. We wound up, at very short notice, giving them a divisional headquarters and three armoured brigades in the south. Now for that you would need first of all six month's notice according to the { Strategy Defence Review } [ Strategy Defence Review ], as we sit here, and - but you would also have to point out, we could only sustain that for a very brief period. And allowing for the new chapter of the { Strategic Defence Review } [ Strategic Defence Review ] we were running two with { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] from 2005 anyway, two medium scale operations without end.  And we couldn't do that. We hadn't got the men, the equipment, the means.LK: So we were hugely overstretched almost from the very beginning?JC: Yes.LK: In terms of your report having put { politicians } [ Politician ] and senior { military } [ Military ] people who were involved under such intense scrutiny, so close to the events really -JC: Yes.LK: Do you think we could ever go to war in the same way, given what your Report uncovered?JC: Oh yes. No question about it. And I don't think we would need a war powers act to prevent us to do that.  But more generally, I think we have seen evidence of - not of a failure of nerve, but of an insistence on much better control of capacity, resources before reaching a decision to do something on that scale. And I don't think that's wrong. Whether the { machinery } [ Machine ] is perfect and whether { memories } [ Memory ] will survive say a { decade } [ Decade ] or two I'm more doubtful, but the lessons are there.LK: So you believe the report should in theory  - could stop a similar rush to war where not enough was being done whether in the legal process or the intelligence process to be sure that it was the right thing?JC: I've got good reason to have real confidence in both the { Ministry of Defence } [ Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) ] institution and in the armed services, to think that they would not allow that to happen without much more rigorous analysis. And just to take one - it's not a small point - but I had so many years in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] where the troops were after all the evolution of our presence there, given extremely clear instructions and orders as to how to operate. What do we do when a bunch of { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] come at us and we've got rifles? Do we shoot or not shoot? Nothing. Now that can never happen again. That was awful.LK: And you believe -JC:   That was professional failure.LK: - that's because the report has brought in a new level of challenge you believe?JC: I believe so. In fact I'm assured so and hope it's so.LK: By whom? What assurances have you had?JC: The rising generations of military. They don't want to be in that position, face a report like ours in ten or twenty years time.LK: So the rising generations of the military have told you they won't make the same mistakes again, because of the Report?JC: Yes, and they weren't their mistakes.LK: What about the { families } [ Family ]?JC: Yes.LK: Do you think the report changed things for them?JC: Well, I can only report what actually happened on the day of the launch. I was extremely uncertain as to what kind of reception we would get. We gave the families an hour and a half before I went into their room and I didn't know whether you'd get boos or brickbats or even rotten tomatoes. Instead we got loud applause. I then made a little talk and at the end of that even louder applause and thank yous and whatever, without real dissent from anywhere in the room. And then on the occasion of the actual launch statement at the end, there was I think something close to a standing ovation from some. Now the sense of relief I experienced was huge. But not to say there wasn't { uncertainty } [ Uncertainty ] {. } [ Uncertainty ] I think the families showed remarkable patience actually and endurance, having to live with real doubts about what would come out. But I have to say one thing which is not to set against that observation - well two. One is we did try to keep contact but the other was it was not a report for an about and to the bereaved families. It was about the whole thing. In that sense quite different from say the { Hillsborough } [ Hillsborough, Massachusetts ] Report. And I have to get in another mention of { Bloody Sunday } [ Bloody Sunday (1938) ]. It wasn't about three hours of an afternoon, it was about eight years.LK: Do you think therefore in your own mind it was worth it?JC: Worth it in the sense of the public money spent, of the human effort involved, I've no doubts about either. I think it was a stopping place looking to the future which may have set, if not a new direction, set new criteria for big scale decision making by governments in conflict situations. And I think that was necessary.LK: And as somebody's still a { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ] watcher, do you think the deficiencies in how government works that you observed and detailed have disappeared? Have the problems been fixed?JC: I think they've been recognised and I hope are in the process of being fixed. I mean certainly institutional changes have been made. National Security Council etcetera, etcetera. But the only test will be in the event, in the future event.LK: What was the worst thing about it for you? Did you have any moments through the whole process where you just thought, argh, this is never gonna work?JC: Not so much that, but both I, and I think I speak here for our very senior military adviser who'd been chief of general staff for the first { Gulf War } [ Gulf War ] and around then, was a disappoint - a profound disappointment - at the failure of professional standards in both civil and military government in too  many cases and on too many occasions. I mean things had really not gone at all well and that - there was individual failing as well as collective institutional failing.LK: And presumably that meant lives were lost because of it?JC: Well, you can't make a direct cause or connection. You can only say a situation was allowed to eventuate and the consequences of that situation were for some people fatal. But you can't then say therefore those people are responsible for those fatalities.LK: Not directly.JC: Yup.LK: And what was the best thing?JC: The best thing at one level was the intellectual rigour and stimulus of the committee and it's quite admirable staff. That was almost a counterbalance to what I've just said about failures of professional standards. This was done by - to my eye - to the best standards I've ever experienced in { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ]. Unfailingly and over a good number of years by a lot of people. I was very pleased about that.LK: And in terms of the best thing about the report's impact? Because the classic public response to these things is to say, it gave us lots of new information but it didn't change any minds. Do you think you changed minds?JC: My hope is that some future minds will have been changed. Because you can't just say that block of volumes never existed. It's there now. It's standing in the way of a { retreat } [ Retreat (spiritual) ] back down the road to a lesser standard.LK: And is that the best thing for you in terms of its impact?JC: Yes.  { It } [ Information technology ] says to { me } [ Me (magazine) ] { it } [ Information technology ] was worthwhile the personal efforts involved by all of { us } [ United States ].LK: So you're glad you said yes when you had a couple of minutes to think about it all those years ago?JC: Now, yes, but there were moments in between. But yes.LK: { Sir } [ Sir ] John, thank you so much."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20160615223039/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23946794": "My last night at the { Toronto Film Festival } [ Toronto International Film Festival ] was spent pretty much like the first: At a huge, noisy, well-liquored party.In many ways the event - enormous, convivial and a little intimidating - felt representative of my festival experience as a whole.The size and scale of this annual showcase can make it difficult to negotiate, especially to a first-time attendee like myself.With a bit of { luck } [ Luck ], { planning } [ Planning ] and persistence, though, it is possible to see, do and achieve pretty much anything to which one sets one's { mind } [ Mind ].But a tip-off from a { Toronto } [ Toronto ] veteran alerted me to an early morning screening at an uptown venue less frequented than the festival's primary locations.Two { subway } [ New York City Subway ] rides and a bit of queuing later, I found myself watching one - or should that be two? - of my personal festival highlights.I left with an even firmer conviction that the pale-skinned, flame-haired { Chastain } [ Jessica Chastain ] is the { Meryl Streep } [ Meryl Streep ] of her generation.Subtitled { Him and Her } [ Him and Her ], the two halves of { Eleanor Rigby } [ Eleanor Rigby ] tell of a young { New York } [ New York City ] couple dealing with a devastating bereavement.Each part works fine as a self-contained story. Seen in tandem, however, you get the whole story - one that is painful and poignant yet ultimately life-affirming.McAvoy is excellent as the impulsive Conor, a struggling { restaurateur } [ Restaurateur ] bewildered when his wife deserts him to start her life afresh.But { Chastain } [ Chastain (TV series) ] is simply outstanding as { Eleanor } [ Eleanor ], transforming before our eyes from a tragic victim of circumstance into an independent woman with a renewed sense of purpose.The unconventional structure and hefty running time of { Ned Benson } [ Ned Benson ]'s film(s) may militate against her { Oscar } [ Academy Awards ] chances this time around.Such accolades, though, are only a matter of time. And yes, { the Beatles } [ The Beatles ] reference is intentional.Based on a novel by the late { Elmore Leonard } [ Elmore Leonard ], this darkly comic tale of a kidnapping gone awry has plenty of amusing moments but not much substance.That its ne'er-do-well protagonists previously featured in { Jackie Brown } [ Jackie Brown ] invites comparisons with { Quentin Tarantino } [ Quentin Tarantino ] {'s } [ Quentin Tarantino ] 1997 film that do { Daniel Schechter } [ Daniel Schechter ] {'s } [ Quentin Tarantino ] no favours.But I did like Mark Boone Junior's turn as a slovenly collector of { Nazi } [ Nazi Germany ] memorabilia, who responds to another character's moral qualms by spluttering: \"What, you don't like history?\"The festival comes to a close in a couple of hours with the presentation of this year's awards, so look out for my report on that later.For now, though, I'll sign off this diary by thanking { Toronto } [ Toronto ] for making me feel so welcome over the last 11 days. Go Blue Jays!With the { festival } [ Film festival ] drawing to a close, I thought I'd say a few words about some of the other films I've seen out here that I haven't mentioned so far.US comedy { Bad Words } [ Bad Words (TV series) ] casts { Jason Bateman } [ Jason Bateman ] as a middle-aged curmudgeon who finds a loophole that allows him to enter a national children's 'spelling bee'.Sweeping aside the competition with his superior { orthography } [ Orthography ], he finds himself pitted against a gifted young boy, with whom he forms an unconventional friendship.Bateman's first film as a director sparked quite the bidding war in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] before finally being snapped up by { Focus Features } [ Focus Features ] for a reported $7m (\u00c2\u00a34.4m).Period drama Belle puts an interesting twist on the genre by making its heroine ( {Gugu Mbatha-Raw } [ Gugu Mbatha-Raw ]) the illegitimate bi-racial daughter of a white admiral and a { Caribbean } [ Caribbean ] slave.Raised as a lady in a wealthy household yet forbidden to dine with them, her unique place in the social hierarchy allows director { Amma Asante } [ Amma Asante ] to address some of the same themes as { 12 Years a Slave } [ 12 Years a Slave (film) ] {. } [ 12 Years a Slave (film) ]Belle, though, is very much the { PG } [ Motion picture content rating system ] version of { Steve McQueen } [ Steve McQueen (director) ] {'s } [ Steve McQueen (director) ] film, being as interested in swooning romance as it is in historical injustice.It's great to look at but a little stuffy, with a sneering turn from former { Harry Potter } [ Harry Potter ] star { Tom Felton } [ Tom Felton ] that's essentially { Draco Malfoy } [ Draco Malfoy ] in a frockcoat.Philomena and Under the Skin both played in { Venice } [ Venice ], so they arrived in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] with a bit of wind in their sails.The former finds Dame { Judi Dench } [ Judi Dench ] in potentially award-grabbing form as an { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] { Catholic } [ Catholic Church ] who sets out to find the son she was forced to give up for { adoption } [ Adoption ] 50 years earlier.The latter sees { Scarlett Johansson } [ Scarlett Johansson ] as an { alien } [ Extraterrestrial life ] in human form who drives around { Scotland } [ Scotland ] looking for men she can feast on.Philomena is a charmer with a fascinating story to tell and an unlikely hero in the form of former { BBC } [ BBC ] journalist turned { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] spin doctor Martin Sixsmith ( {Steve Coogan } [ Steve Coogan ]).Under the Skin, alas, is a pretentious snooze that would probably provoke titters of derision if it wasn't so boring.Set in a { British } [ United Kingdom ] prison where violence and intimidation are commonplace, { Starred Up } [ Starred Up ] feels like a homegrown version of the { French } [ France ] film { A Prophet } [ A Prophet ].Lurking beneath the thuggery, though, is a sentimental streak as new inmate Eric (Jack O'Connell) finds himself sharing a wing with his old lag of a father ( {Ben Mendelsohn } [ Ben Mendelsohn ]).David Mackenzie's powerfully-acted drama has a brooding intensity and feels grimly authentic. But I still found myself longing for an early release.I was also distracted by { Mendelsohn } [ Mendelsohn family ]'s accent, a curious amalgam of estuary { English } [ England ] and his native { Australian } [ Australia ] drawl.Karen Gillan does a better job adopting an { American } [ United States ] twang in Oculus, a blood-splattered { horror film } [ Horror film ] about a haunted mirror.Part of the festival's Midnight Madness strand, it's a predictably gory affair with some well-staged shocks that could go on to enjoy cult success.The { Stag } [ The Stag ], meanwhile, is a rambunctious { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] comedy about a group of male friends on a debauched { stag } [ The Stag ] weekend in the country.Its best moment, though, comes when { Sherlock } [ Sherlock (TV series) ] actor { Andrew Scott } [ Andrew Scott (actor) ] quietly performs a beautiful rendition of the old { folk } [ Folk music ] standard { Raglan Road } [ Raglan Road ].I didn't get a chance to see August: Osage County, a heavily-hyped family drama with { Meryl Streep } [ Meryl Streep ], { Julia Roberts } [ Julia Roberts ] and { Ewan McGregor } [ Ewan McGregor ] heading a very starry cast.I also missed { All Is On My Side } [ All Is on My Side ], a { biopic } [ Biographical film ] about { Jimi Hendrix } [ Jimi Hendrix ] that focuses on the early life of the legendary { rock } [ Rock music ] musician.But there are only so many hours in the day, and you can't spend all of them inside a movie theatre.With that in mind, I think I'll do a bit of sight-seeing.Last week there was a lot of talk about { Benedict Cumberbatch } [ Benedict Cumberbatch ] being \"the man of the festival\", thanks to his roles in three { Toronto } [ Toronto ] titles.Daniel Radcliffe has also been feted for having three films in the line-up, prompting one publication to call him the event's \"unofficial poster-boy\".Australian actress { Mia Wasikowska } [ Mia Wasikowska ] also has three movies showing this year, all of which have been enthusiastically received.Yet no-one to my knowledge has been calling her \"the woman of the festival\". Maybe I should start.I've already written about Only Lovers Left Alive, in which the 23-year-old { Canberran } [ Canberra ] plays a flighty { vampire } [ Vampire ] who can't be trusted around { humans } [ Human ].I've since seen the other titles in which she appears, which show the { Alice in Wonderland } [ Alice's Adventures in Wonderland ] { actress } [ Actor ] to be as versatile as she is prolific.In { Tracks } [ Tracks (TV series) ], she plays Robyn Davidson, a real-life nomad who trekked 2,000 miles across the { outback } [ Outback ] with only a dog and four camels for company.Wasikowska effectively conveys { Robyn } [ Robyn ] {'s } [ Robyn ] indomitable spirit in an unaffected and refreshingly ungroomed performance.John Curran's film boasts awesome desert scenery that emphasises the solitude, hardship and danger its heroine willingly signed up for.It also opens with an unusual warning, aimed at { Aborigines } [ Indigenous peoples of the Americas ], that it might contain the voices of people who have died.I then saw Mia in { Richard Ayoade } [ Richard Ayoade ]'s { The Double } [ The Double (1996 film) ], playing the elusive and ethereal object of { Jesse Eisenberg } [ Jesse Eisenberg ]'s affections.There are two Eisenbergs in this { Dostoyevsky } [ Fyodor Dostoevsky ] adaptation, set in a grimly mechanised vision of the future reminiscent of { Terry Gilliam } [ Terry Gilliam ]'s { Brazil } [ Brazil ].One Jesse is a meek and downtrodden milquetoast, while the other is a smoothly confident { doppelganger } [ Doppelg\u00e4nger ] who invades and takes over his life.The { film } [ Film ] as a whole is rather muddled. But I did like the cheesy { Blake's 7 } [ Blake's 7 ] parody, starring { Paddy Considine } [ Paddy Considine ], that's always playing when any character turns on a { television } [ Television ].Wasikowska, by the way, will be next be seen alongside { Robert Pattinson } [ Robert Pattinson ] in { David Cronenberg } [ David Cronenberg ]'s 2014 release { Maps to the Stars } [ Maps to the Stars ]. As the { festival } [ Festival ] nears its end, though, there's a distinct shortage in the star department.Yet there are still a few familiar faces in the vicinity, with more to come as we enter the final weekend.The most recent flash of glamour came courtesy of { Pierce Brosnan } [ Pierce Brosnan ] and { Emma Thompson } [ Emma Thompson ], in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] to launch light-hearted heist caper { The Love Punch } [ The Love Punch ].The former { James Bond } [ James Bond ] and the two-time { Oscar } [ Academy Awards ] winner play a divorced couple who set aside their differences to stage a jewel theft on the { French Riviera } [ French Riviera ] {. } [ French Riviera ] It's a beautiful romp of a film and we hit the ground running.\"\"For us it was the best summer ever,\" agreed { Thompson } [ Lisa Thompson ], adding that the { stunt } [ Stunt ] driving she performed for the film had made her keen to pursue similar opportunities.\"It really gave me a taste for it,\" she revealed.\"One of the most popular and colourful sidebars at the { Toronto Film Festival } [ Toronto International Film Festival ] is the Midnight Madness section, a nightly orgy of culty thrills from the worlds of { horror } [ Horror film ], { fantasy } [ Fantasy film ] and { action } [ Action film ].I got my first taste of it the other night and was captivated by the exuberance and enthusiasm of an audience markedly younger than the ones I have been a part of elsewhere.I asked { Colin Geddes } [ Colin Geddes ], { programmer } [ Programmer ] of the section, whether this physical separation reflected the sidebar's outsider status, apart and distinct from the rest of the line-up.\"Very much so,\" he agreed. \"It is a { festival } [ Festival ] within a { festival } [ Festival ], with a very different energy.\"There's { music } [ Music ] playing, people are excited and sometimes there's a { beach } [ Beach ] ball.\"The night I was there, to see a low-budget { alien abduction } [ Alien abduction ] thriller called Almost Human, someone had brought an inflatable alien to be bounced around beforehand.Yet once the { movie } [ Film ] started the { audience } [ Audience ] became almost eerily quiet, at least until the first instance of extra-terrestrial hostility.\"The { audience } [ Audience ] is respectful,\" { Geddes } [ Michael Geddes ] nods. \"They don't yell out at the screen. They're there for the experience.\"For the first five to 10 minutes, they're waiting to feel what the tone of the film is. And then they just slide right into it.\"Midnight Madness was first held 25 years ago to cater for cinemagoers who were having difficulty relating to the festival's more serious fair.\"Back then it was mainly foreign-language, art-house cinema,\" Geddes explains. \"If you'd never been to a { film festival } [ Film festival ] before, it was a little impenetrable.\"But everyone can relate to { horror } [ Horror film ] films, to { black comedies } [ Black comedy ], to { martial arts } [ Martial arts ] movies. So in many ways it's been a gateway drug to get audiences into the festival.\"According to Geddes, the careers of { Peter Jackson } [ Peter Jackson ], { Eli Roth } [ Eli Roth ] and { Japan } [ Japan ]'s Shin'ya Tsukamoto are among those to have been boosted significantly by Midnight Madness exposure.He also recalled a few occasions when ticket holders found its offerings too hard to stomach.\"When we showed { Eli Roth } [ Eli Roth ]'s Hostel in 2005 we had two people passing out,\" he says.\" {Eli } [ Eli (film) ], of course, took that as a badge of honour.\"\"People in the music industry don't make good life partners,\" says a character in Can A Song Save Your Life?, which sees { Keira Knightley } [ Keira Knightley ] play a budding { singer-songwriter } [ Singer-songwriter ] trying to make it in { New York } [ New York City ].The irony is that Knightley recently tied the knot with a person in the { music industry } [ Music industry ] - the splendidly named { James Righton } [ James Righton ], from { indie } [ Independent music ] rockers { Klaxons } [ Klaxons ].There's been a lot of interest in { John Carney } [ John Carney (director) ]'s follow-up to the { Oscar-winning } [ Academy Awards ] { Once } [ Once (film) ], particularly after { The Weinstein Company } [ The Weinstein Company ] acquired its US distribution rights for a cool $7 million (\u00c2\u00a34.4m).The story of a jaded music producer ( {Mark Ruffalo } [ Mark Ruffalo ]) who encourages the newly jilted Greta ( {Knightley } [ Knightley ]) to make good on her potential, Can A Song\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 mirrors Once so closely one might almost call it Twice.As before, the action involves an older man and a younger woman, their will they/won't they relationship and a veritable tsunami of poignant guitar ballads.At one point { James Corden } [ James Corden ], in his role as Greta's best friend, even appears to be imitating the angst-ridden performance style of { Once } [ Once (band) ]'s { Glen Hansard } [ Glen Hansard ].As derivative as it is, though, it still works a treat, charming and disarming in equal measure with its { humour } [ Humour ], heart and honesty.Corden cropped up again this week in { One Chance } [ One Chance (TV series) ], a trite comedy inspired by the overnight success of { Britain's Got Talent } [ Britain's Got Talent ] winner { Paul Potts } [ Paul Potts (actor) ].On this occasion { Corden } [ Paul Corden ] lets { Potts } [ Paul Potts (actor) ] do the warbling in a heavily fictionalised version of his life story that it would be misleading to call a { biopic } [ Biographical film ] {. } [ Biographical film ]We're also told his first { BGT } [ British GT ] appearance was broadcast live, something that could never happen given how the show's produced.David Frankel's film was financed by the Weinsteins and is self-evidently aimed at a { North American } [ North America ] audience.There's a song from { Taylor Swift } [ Taylor Swift ] over the end credits, while at one point { Corden } [ James Corden ] pops into { Boots } [ Boots (musical) ] to purchase adult diapers.Ask for { diapers } [ Diaper ] down your local branch and you'll likely get an expression of bewilderment.Let's hope they do a better job when they film the { Susan Boyle } [ Susan Boyle ] story. Come to think of it {, } [ List of One Piece characters ] { Corden } [ Corden (actor) ] could probably play { her } [ List of One Piece characters ] as well {. } [ List of One Piece characters ]Remember that press screening of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom on Saturday that was abruptly halted about 45 minutes in?Well, the scuttlebutt going around is that there might be more than meets the eye to the \"unforeseen mechanical difficulty\" blamed for its curtailment.The rumour is that somebody on high wasn't too thrilled by the idea of potentially disparaging reviews appearing ahead of the film's world premiere that evening and took decisive steps to prevent it.It's all completely unsubstantiated, as most good rumours are. But I must admit it did smell a little fishy at the time.Tuesday, by the way, saw { Toronto } [ Toronto ] bask in a mini-heatwave that pushed the mercury up to a sweltering 32 degrees centigrade.\"I've got to get a beverage,\" I heard one local remark.\"Yet a solution is on hand for those wishing to beat the heat: a labyrinth of subterranean malls and walkways that allow one to negotiate the heart of the city in air-conditioned comfort.It certainly beats a simmering sidewalk or { subway } [ New York City Subway ] carriage - and you can pop into { Urban Outfitters } [ Urban Outfitters ] en route.Three of my more unsettling minutes at this year's festival were spent watching { Jude Law } [ Jude Law ] wax lyrical about his { penis } [ Penis ] {. } [ Penis ]Not in person, of course. That would be unthinkable. No, I'm talking about his new film Dom Hemingway, which opens with its titular moustachioed hard man, played by Law, delivering a soliloquy in praise of his \"exquisite\" appendage.Law continues in like vein in this violent, blackly comic crime caper about a volatile safe-cracker (\"I've got anger issues!\"), which I am tempted to call his Sexy Beast.Back in 2000, that film gave { Sir } [ Sir ] { Ben Kingsley } [ Ben Kingsley ] a perception-altering role as a psychotic headcase. It's conceivable { Dom } [ Dom (biblical figure) ] may do the same for { Jude } [ Jude (biblical figure) ] {. } [ Jude (biblical figure) ]\"I asked the { director } [ Film director ] { Richard Shepard } [ Richard Shepard ] if we could shoot that scene first,\" the { actor } [ Actor ] told reporters in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] this week.\"According to the 40-year-old star, the festival felt like \"exactly the right place\" to launch his latest venture, which has its UK release on 8 November.\"I've been coming here for 12 years with films of all shapes and sizes, and this one seems like a very good fit,\" he said.\"It's a tough market place out there, and a { film } [ Film ] this size is fighting against { films } [ Film ] that are 200 times bigger. That's all the more reason for it to be embraced by a festival like { TIFF } [ Toronto International Film Festival ].\"It's easy to be seduced by the glamour, energy and hoopla of the { Toronto Film Festival } [ Toronto International Film Festival ], now on its sixth, predictably hectic day.It's refreshing, therefore, to see a group of enterprising film-makers seek to channel that energy into something a little more substantial than the promotion and selling of movies.Canadian director { Atom Egoyan } [ Atom Egoyan ], his countrywoman { Sarah Polley } [ Sarah Polley ] and documentarian { Alex Gibney } [ Alex Gibney ] are spearheading a campaign calling for the release of two individuals who were arrested in { Cairo } [ Cairo ] on 16 August.According to the campaigners, film-maker { John Greyson } [ John Greyson ] and doctor Tarek Loubani have been detained in prison ever since, without being formally charged.\"With so many people from other countries in town this week, it's a great moment to raise international awareness,\" Polley told me earlier.\"We just wanted to take full advantage of any opportunity to keep this story in the public eye.\" {Paul Giamatti } [ Paul Giamatti ] and { Emma Thompson } [ Emma Thompson ] are among the celebrities who are showing their support by wearing one of the bright red buttons - another word for badge - that are being used to promote the initiative.There's more about the { campaign } [ Political campaign ] on the { website } [ Website ] www.tarekandjohn.comMonday night saw the likes of { Nicolas Cage } [ Nicolas Cage ], { Scarlett Johansson } [ Scarlett Johansson ], { Julia Roberts } [ Julia Roberts ] and { Taylor Swift } [ Taylor Swift ] tread red carpets at various venues across { Toronto } [ Toronto ].But hey, why bother with those guys when you can hang out with { Craig } [ Craig Reid (singer) ] and { Charlie Reid } [ Charlie Reid (singer) ] from { The Proclaimers } [ The Proclaimers ]?The { Scottish } [ Scotland ] twins travelled a lot further than 500 Miles to attend the world premiere of Sunshine on Leith, an { Edinburgh-based } [ Edinburgh ] musical that uses their songs to propel its narrative.Their reward was by the far the warmest welcome I've seen a film receive at this festival, capped off by a prolonged standing ovation.Based on a stage musical first presented at Dundee Rep in 2007, Sunshine tells of two squaddies returning from { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] to an uncertain future in { Scotland } [ Scotland ].Work and { family } [ Family ] troubles make it doubly hard to readjust. But not to worry, because there's always a jaunty Proclaimers number waiting in the wings to buck up their spirits.I suppose one could call it McMamma Mia. And in the hands of { actor } [ Actor ] turned { director } [ Film director ] { Dexter Fletcher } [ Dexter Fletcher ] it's a recipe for joyous, uninhibited, unadulterated fun.That fun continued at an after-party that saw { Craig } [ Craig Morgan ] and { Charlie } [ Charlie Mitchell (singer) ] perform a selection of their hits for a select gathering that included { Andrew Scott } [ Andrew Scott (actor) ] of { Sherlock } [ Sherlock (TV series) ] fame.The { film } [ Film ]'s title proved prophetic last November when its shooting { on location } [ Location shooting ] was blessed with day upon day without { rain } [ Rain ]. \"Trust me: For { Scottish } [ Scotland ] { tourism } [ Tourism ] it's brilliant.\"Sometimes even { movie } [ Film ] { stars } [ Movie star ] get upstaged. Just ask { Sandra Bullock } [ Sandra Bullock ] at last night's premiere of { Gravity } [ Gravity (TV series) ] {. } [ Gravity (TV series) ]The audience cheered her robustly as she walked on stage to introduce the film, in which she plays a { Nasa } [ NASA ] { astronaut } [ Astronaut ] coping with a calamity in space.But they went positively potty over real { Canadian } [ Canada ] { astronaut } [ Astronaut ] { Chris Hadfield } [ Chris Hadfield ], a man who had actually done the things we were about to see simulated on screen.I can see why { Alfonso Cuaron } [ Alfonso Cuaron ]'s { movie } [ Film ] was so warmly received in { Venice } [ Venice ] {. } [ Venice ] It's a gripping, pulse-quickening thrill ride with astounding { 3D } [ 3D film ] visuals.Behind the spectacle, though, I couldn't help detecting a { geopolitical } [ Geopolitics ] { subtext } [ Subtext ] {. } [ Subtext ]The disaster that cripples the shuttle Bullock shares with veteran spacewalker { George Clooney } [ George Clooney ] is caused by the { Russians } [ Russia ] blowing up one of their own satellites and the debris shower it causes.Their salvation, meanwhile, hangs on a { Chinese } [ China ] escape pod they must get to and pilot if they're to have any hope of returning home.Daniel Radcliffe made quite a stir a few years back when he bared all on stage in { Equus } [ Equus (play) ].He's at it again in The F Word, a romantic comedy that at one point sees him strip off to go skinny-dipping in a chilly { Lake Ontario } [ Lake Ontario ].He'll catch his death at this rate. Yet it's all in the service of a witty depiction of a \"let's be friends\" courtship that, as well as providing its star an appealing post-Potter vehicle, happens to be set in { Toronto } [ Toronto ].It occurred to me afterwards that I had seen more of the { city } [ City ] by watching it than I'd done in five days of actually being here.Other { Brits } [ United Kingdom ] who've been flying the flag include a pregnant { Kate Winslet } [ Kate Winslet ], in town to launch her new film { Labor Day } [ Labor Day (film) ] {. } [ Labor Day (film) ]It's not a reference to her condition, but to the { American } [ United States ] { public holiday } [ Public holiday ] on which some of its action is set.Based on a novel by { Joyce Maynard } [ Joyce Maynard ], it tells of a single mother and her young son who are taken hostage in their home by an escaped convict.As a { pilot } [ Television pilot ] for a cookery show, { Jason Reitman } [ Jason Reitman ]'s { film } [ Film ] shows promise. As a { drama } [ Drama ] {, } [ List of American films of the 1980s ] it's missing a few ingredients {. } [ List of American films of the 1980s ]Speaking after its screening on Saturday, { Winslet } [ Jamie Winslet ] revealed her current circumstances precluded her watching a distressing scene in which her character suffers a { miscarriage } [ Miscarriage ] {. } [ Miscarriage ]Andrew Macdonald, the Scottish producer of { Trainspotting } [ Trainspotting (film) ] and { 28 Days Later } [ 28 Days Later ], is also in { Toronto } [ Toronto ], along with his director brother { Kevin } [ Kevin Macdonald (director) ].The former is here to launch the { Proclaimers } [ The Proclaimers ]-inspired musical { Sunshine } [ Sunshine (The Proclaimers song) ] on { Leith } [ Leith ], while the latter is screening his apocalyptic war parable { How I Live Now } [ How I Live Now ].In a quirk of fraternal fate, the two titles are set be released in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] on the same day - 4 October this year.I asked { Andrew } [ Andrew Finch ] if he and his { brother } [ Andrew C. Finch ] would be comparing { box office } [ Box office ] receipts to see which of them comes out on top. \"No, but our kids will,\" he laughed.Okay, so you know that { Dallas Buyers Club } [ Dallas Buyers Club ] premiere I mentioned earlier? Well, it turned out to be a big fat bust.Matthew McConaughey wafted past us without so much as a word, for all our trumpeting of his { Oscar } [ Academy Awards ]-worthy performance.Bad McConaughey. That's the last time I see one of your daft rom-coms.But I was glad to have made the effort, if only to share a couple of minutes with his co-star { Jared Leto } [ Jared Leto ] {. } [ Jared Leto ]The { Requiem for a Dream } [ Requiem for a Dream ] actor is also the frontman for { Thirty Seconds to Mars } [ Thirty Seconds to Mars ] and, on clocking I was from { England } [ England ], was quick to mention the band's { UK } [ United Kingdom ] tour dates in November.Here is a man who recognises the value of good { publicity } [ Publicity ] {. } [ Publicity ] { McConaughey } [ Alistair McConaughey ], take note.Around this time I had hoped to bring you my reaction to { Mandela } [ Nelson Mandela ]: Long Walk to Freedom, a hefty adaptation of the { South African } [ South Africa ] figurehead's autobiography starring { Idris Elba } [ Idris Elba ] in the title role.Unfortunately, around 45 minutes into the screening, the movie stopped, the lights came up and we were told it could no longer continue due to an \"unforeseen mechanical difficulty\".I should have read the { runes } [ Runes ] from the fact that the { escalator } [ Escalator ] up to the { cinema } [ Movie theater ] was broken. All in all, it turned out to be a pretty short walk to freedom.But it is clear { Elba } [via Elba ] gives a commanding performance in a { biopic } [ Biographical film ] that, from what little I saw, may prove a little conventional for some viewers' tastes.What's a { reporter } [ Journalist ] to do? Well, maybe tell you what I thought of some of the other titles that have screened so far.Prisoners, an intense { thriller } [ Thriller (genre) ] about { child abduction } [ Child abduction ], boasts an angry, angst-ridden turn from { Hugh Jackman } [ Hugh Jackman ] as a father who will go to any lengths to locate his missing daughter. But the { film } [ Film ] as a whole, the work of the { Canadian } [ Canada ] { Denis Villeneuve } [ Denis Villeneuve ], is too overwrought and improbable to boot.The { Invisible Woman } [ The Invisible Woman (2012 film) ], directed by and starring { Ralph Fiennes } [ Ralph Fiennes ], tells of { Charles Dickens } [ Charles Dickens ]' mistress, an actress named { Nelly Ternan } [ Nelly Ternan ], and the lengths the author took to keep their affair secret.Partly funded by { BBC Films } [ BBC Films ], it's a lavish period drama with an accomplished cast that, try as it might, never quite catches fire.Maybe it's the { facial hair } [ Facial hair ] {. } [ Facial hair ] It's hard to get caught up in a love story when you're being continually distracted by mutton-chop sideburns and beards.The { Sopranos } [ The Sopranos ] actor is cast against type as a lonely divorcee whose new relationship with a masseuse - { Seinfeld } [ Seinfeld ]'s { Julia Louis-Dreyfus } [ Julia Louis-Dreyfus ] - is undermined when she unwittingly takes on his ex-wife as a client.It's a slight yet charming piece from an { American } [ United States ] writer-director called { Nicole Holofcener } [ Nicole Holofcener ] who specialises in female-oriented comedies of romantic misunderstanding.I randomly bumped into { Louis-Dreyfus } [ Mary Louis-Dreyfus ]'s husband in a hotel elevator on Friday, something I'll be sure to bring up when I interview her next week.After three days of blazing sunshine, { Toronto } [ Toronto ] woke up to rain on what is now the third day of an increasingly hectic { film festival } [ Film festival ] {. } [ Film festival ]After catching { Parkland } [ Parkland (film) ] last night, a multi-stranded, rather exploitative drama about JFK's assassination 50 years ago and the Dallas hospital where his body was taken, I arose bright and early to see { Colin Firth } [ Colin Firth ] and { Nicole Kidman } [ Nicole Kidman ] in { The Railway Man } [ The Railway Man (film) ].Based on the story of Eric Lomax, a { British } [ United Kingdom ] prisoner of war forced to work on the construction of the { Thai } [ Thailand ]/ {Burma } [ Burma ] railway during { World War II } [ World War II ], it's an earnest but rather torpid affair that feels like a footnote to { The Bridge on the River Kwai } [ The Bridge on the River Kwai ].Firth plays Lomax in middle age, looking back on the traumatic ordeal he endured as a younger man ( {Jeremy Irvine } [ Jeremy Irvine ]) while nursing fantasies of avenging himself on his chief { Japanese } [ Japan ] tormentor.This latter element leads to some questionable melodramatic embellishments that detract from rather than bolster the film's central theme of { forgiveness } [ Forgiveness ] and { reconciliation } [ Conflict resolution ].Far superior to both of the above is { Dallas Buyers Club } [ Dallas Buyers Club ], a showcase for resurgent star { Matthew McConaughey } [ Matthew McConaughey ] that's practically guaranteed to secure him his first { Oscar } [ Academy Awards ] nomination.The { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ] heartthrob is a sight to behold as Ron Woodroof, an HIV positive rodeo cowboy in 1980s { Texas } [ Texas ] who turns to illicitly obtained, alternative treatments to help him battle the onset of { Aids } [ HIV/AIDS ].Scarily emaciated, the { actor } [ Actor ] nonetheless exudes charisma and defiance as he fights his { doctors } [ Physician ] and the { authorities } [ Authority ] over the \"buyers club\" he establishes for fellow patients.An unrecognisable { Jared Leto } [ Jared Leto ] also shines as a flighty { transsexual } [ Transsexual ] who becomes { Ron } [ Ron Swanson ]'s partner in crime, for all his { homophobic } [ Homophobia ] tendencies.The film, the work of { Canadian } [ Canada ] director { Jean-Marc Vallee } [ Jean-Marc Vallee ], runs out of gas before the end, but not before confirming { McConaughey } [ Sean McConaughey ] as one of this awards season's leading candidates for honours.I'll be on the { red carpet } [ Red carpet ] tonight at the { film } [ Film ]'s { premiere } [ Premiere ], so check back later to see how I got on.With so many movies showing in so many different cinemas, the ever-present fear at { Toronto } [ Toronto ] is that you're missing the must-see.That definitely wasn't the case on Friday evening, which I spent at a \"special presentation\" of the heavily { Oscar } [ Academy Awards ]-tipped { 12 Years a Slave } [ 12 Years a Slave (film) ] {. } [ 12 Years a Slave (film) ]The \"special\" came courtesy of a dashing on-stage line-up featuring { Brad Pitt } [ Brad Pitt ], { Michael Fassbender } [ Michael Fassbender ] and the ubiquitous { Benedict Cumberbatch } [ Benedict Cumberbatch ] {. } [ Benedict Cumberbatch ]It was the \"presentation\", though, that made the night worthwhile. From the very beginning, I had no doubt I was watching one of the strongest titles in this year's programme.Steve McQueen's gripping and gruelling saga tells the story of { Solomon Northup } [ Solomon Northup ], a free black musician from { Saratoga } [ Saratoga, New York ] {, New York } [ Saratoga, New York ] who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841.His suffering and exploitation at the hands of a succession of slave owners is unflinchingly detailed in a film that lays bare the cruelty and barbarity of this heinous institution.The whippings, beatings, kickings and lynchings make for a difficult watch, and one sudden act of unprovoked violence had the audience gasping in dismay.Yet the harshness of such scenes is tempered by a lyrical beauty elsewhere that is enhanced further by the stirring { Negro } [ Negro ] spirituals used to underpin the action.At one point Solomon - the excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor - is forced to destroy a letter to his family that, if found by his \"master\", will surely result in his demise.McQueen holds the { camera } [ Camera ] on the paper as it burns, its smouldering embers mirroring the death of his { hero } [ Hero ] {'s } [ Hero ] last slim hope of salvation.Speaking after the screening, the { Turner-winning } [ J. M. W. Turner ] artist turned award-winning film-maker said he had been drawn to make a drama about { slavery } [ Slavery ] because he felt no such drama existed.\" {Steve } [ Steve Pitt ] was the first to ask the big question,\" said { Pitt } [ Steve Pitt ], who appears in the film (which he co-produced) as a { Canadian } [ Canada ] { abolitionist } [ Abolitionism ]. \"Why have there not been more films on the { American } [ United States ] history of { slavery } [ Slavery ]?\"It was a big question and it took a { Brit } [ United Kingdom ] to ask it. And I just have to say, if I never get to participate in a { film } [ Film ] again, then this is it for me.\"Expect to hear a lot more about { 12 Years a Slave } [ 12 Years a Slave (film) ] as the movie awards season gets under way.Though the focus was on { The Fifth Estate } [ The Fifth Estate (film) ] last night and its { black tie } [ Black tie ] premiere, it certainly was not the only film to make its { Toronto } [ Toronto ] debut on Thursday.So did { Blue is the Warmest Colour } [ Blue Is the Warmest Colour ], the winner of the { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ] at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] this year, which I caught in { London } [ London ] last week.Running three hours long and featuring some of the most graphic { lesbian } [ Lesbian ] sex ever simulated on camera, it's being released in { North America } [ North America ] with an NC-17 certificate - the most restrictive rating there is for a mainstream release.Controversy is swirling around this critically acclaimed coming-of-age story after its two lead actresses, { Lea Seydoux } [ Lea Seydoux ] and { Adele Exarchopoulus } [ Adele Exarchopoulus ], said the shoot had been \"horrible\" and that they would never work with director { Abdellatif Kechiche } [ Abdellatif Kechiche ] again.Kechiche was none too impressed with those comments, prompting Seydoux to tearfully issue a partial retraction.Let's hope this sideshow does not impact on the { film } [ Film ] itself, a riveting and unflinching { rite of passage } [ Rite of passage ] built around two intensely committed performances.The { Toronto Film Festival } [ Toronto International Film Festival ]'s opening night party was an enjoyable if slightly rum do. Held partly on the street and partly in a { shopping mall } [ Shopping mall ], it felt like several shindigs at once, united by a vaguely { British } [ United Kingdom ] theme.The menu included such { English } [ England ] culinary staples as { Beef Wellington } [ Beef Wellington ] and good old { fish and chips } [ Fish and chips ], while guests had the opportunity to pose beside a retro-style, bright red phone box.Were they of a mind to, they could also munch on bags of { popcorn } [ Popcorn ] bearing the name of { The Fifth Estate } [ The Fifth Estate (film) ], the festival's opening night film.Bill Condon's drama was not half as corny as that dubious honour might suggest. But it was a little bland and lacking in texture.Charting the swift rise of cyberspace renegade { Julian Assange } [ Julian Assange ] and his secrecy-busting { WikiLeaks } [ WikiLeaks ] website, the film follows a similar template to that of { Facebook } [ Facebook ] movie { The Social Network } [ The Social Network ].Again we see a brusque, not particularly likeable visionary sacrifice friends and ethics in his quest to make his pioneering internet venture a rulebook-rewriting phenomenon.Sporting a white fright wig and a languid { Australian } [ Australia ] drawl, { Benedict Cumberbatch } [ Benedict Cumberbatch ] memorably portrays { Assange } [ Julian Assange ] as a single-minded iconoclast driven by a childhood trauma that is revisited obliquely in surreal flashbacks.That element extends to a number of striking dream sequences that at one point conjure up 100 grinning Cumberbatches, each operating a { laptop } [ Laptop ] computer in a { Kubrickian } [ Stanley Kubrick ] vision of an office.The problem is that where { The Social Network } [ The Social Network ] boasted an { Oscar-winning } [ Academy Awards ] script by { Aaron Sorkin } [ Aaron Sorkin ] full of wit and one-liners, { The Fifth Estate } [ The Fifth Estate (TV series) ] has a clunky and declarative one (by { Josh Singer } [ Josh Singer ]) that spells everything out in capital letters.WikiLeaks, we are informed, is \"a window into every government in the world\", a \"diplomatic nightmare\" behind \"the biggest leak of confidential information in history\".At times it almost sounds like a press release that wastes no opportunity to paint { Assange } [ Julian Assange ] as a heroic bastion for { transparency } [ Transparency (behavior) ] and { free speech } [ Freedom of speech ], for all his { egotism } [ Egotism ] and personal foibles.Assange himself has been dismissive of the project, calling the film the \"anti-WikiLeaks movie\" in an interview filmed at the { Ecuadorian } [ Ecuador ] embassy in { London } [ London ] where he has been residing since June 2012.I am told the { movie } [ Film ] - which I saw at a separate screening for the { press } [ News media ] and { industry } [ Film industry ] - drew a respectful but hardly ecstatic response at the opening night gala.And { Variety } [ Variety (magazine) ]'s reviewer appeared to concur, describing the film as \"cluttered\", \"too busy\" and \"overly frenetic\".While we're on the theme of releasing sensitive information, I was intrigued to learn that { Toronto } [ Toronto ] has its own hush-hush equivalent of { Nando } [ Nando's ]'s much-sought after \"black card\".Only a hundred \"Pronto\" cards are issued, but those in possession of one have access to any screening no matter how \"full\" or \"sold out\" it supposedly is.The owners have to pay an eye-watering sum for the privilege, but it certainly saves time that would otherwise be spent waiting in line with the riff-raff.As far as we know, though, { peri peri } [ Peri peri ] chicken is not included.I'd heard great things about { Don Jon } [ Don Jon ], the directorial debut of Looper and { Inception } [ Inception ] star { Joseph Gordon-Levitt } [ Joseph Gordon-Levitt ], from when it screened in { Sundance } [ Sundance Film Festival ] in January, so when I saw it was playing in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] I was keen to catch it.I'm glad to say this tale of a swaggering skirt-chaser secretly addicted to internet porn did not disappoint. It's a hoot.Gordon-Levitt displays real presence as the { New Jersey } [ New Jersey ] Don Juan who gets more than he bargains for when he initiates a courtship with gum-chewing vixen { Scarlett Johansson } [ Scarlett Johansson ].The film has some smart things to say about the { objectification } [ Objectification ] of women in { cyberspace } [ Cyberspace ] and the different things men and women crave from { relationships } [ Interpersonal relationship ].Mostly, though, it's just very funny, thanks in part to a resurgent { Tony Danza } [ Tony Danza ] as { Jon } [ Jon Stewart ]'s bullish { Alpha Male } [ Alpha (ethology) ] of a father.The critics were a bit sniffy when it screened in { Cannes } [ Cannes ] in May, but I found it something of a return to form for a director who infuriates as often as he satisfies.Tilda Swinton and Mia Wasikowska, meanwhile, make deliciously infernal sisters in an oddball story of dark desire and bloodlust that offers a mischievous spin on the { Twilight } [ The Twilight Saga ] series' teenage love triangle.Things seemed rather quiet in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] when I arrived on Wednesday, but this morning things are buzzing.Camera crews jockey for position on the sidewalk, queues snake outside screening rooms and box offices, and barriers have been placed on the street in expectation of huge crowds.One that has caught my eye, possibly for sentimental reasons, is a 30th anniversary showing of baby boomer classic { The Big Chill } [ The Big Chill (film) ] {. } [ The Big Chill (film) ]Lawrence Kasdan's comedy drama about college friends reuniting had its premiere in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] in 1983, so someone had the bright idea of reuniting its cast this year for a special reunion.Glenn Close, { Kevin Kline } [ Kevin Kline ] and { Tom Berenger } [ Tom Berenger ] - remember him? - are among those expected at what is sure to be a premium exercise in celluloid nostalgia.My morning began with one of the { festival } [ Festival ] {'s } [ Art festival ] fabulous { publicists } [ Publicist ] inviting me to this evening {'s } [ Art festival ] opening night party. It's a tough job etc. And our captain's { Presley } [ Elvis Presley ]-style \"Thank you very much\" couldn't help put a smile on his passengers' faces as we commenced our seven-hour flight from { London } [ London ] to { Toronto } [ Toronto ] on Wednesday.Some turbulence en route left me all shook up, as did the shocking quality of one of the films I'd selected from the mid-air entertainment.Here's hoping I won't see its equal among the { film festival } [ Film festival ] titles I hope to catch over the next 10 days.The { festival } [ Festival ] itself starts on Thursday. As a newcomer to the { city } [ City ], though, I thought it prudent to arrive the day before and get my bearings.This was better thought than done. With its inflexible grid system and abundance of gleaming glass towers, a lot of { Toronto } [ Toronto ] thoroughfares look markedly similar to each other.My first impression of the { city } [ City ] was that it will look great when it's finished. I don't think I've ever seen so many building sites in such close proximity.Luckily one is able to bypass a great deal of them by cutting through the spacious, multi-level { shopping malls } [ Shopping mall ] that appear to occupy every street corner.My tasks for the day were simple ones. Pick up my press pass. Arrange some tickets. Attend a meet-and-greet organised by local film critics.The latter event was a convivial affair that involved much speculation over what the opening night film, { Julian Assange } [ Julian Assange ] biopic { The Fifth Estate } [ The Fifth Estate (film) ] {, } [ The Fifth Estate (film) ] will be like.The original plan had been to show the movie to the press a few hours before the official gala on Thursday, to be attended by leading man { Benedict Cumberbatch } [ Benedict Cumberbatch ] and other cast members.But the press screening was abruptly switched earlier this week to late on Thursday evening, a move that piqued the curiosity of several journalists I spoke to.I've only been in town for half a day but I've already enjoyed a celebrity encounter. Walking down the street I was surprised to see { Daniel Bruhl } [ Daniel Bruhl ] strolling in the opposite direction.I felt compelled to congratulate him on his compelling performance as { Niki Lauda } [ Niki Lauda ] in { Formula 1 } [ Formula One ] biopic { Rush } [ Rush (2008 film) ] which is showing in { Toronto } [ Toronto ] this weekend following its premiere in { London } [ London ] on Monday.The busy { German } [ Germany ] actor also appears in { The Fifth Estate } [ The Fifth Estate (TV series) ] as { Daniel Domscheit-Berg } [ Daniel Domscheit-Berg ], the former spokesman for { Assange } [ Julian Assange ]'s { WikiLeaks } [ WikiLeaks ] website.Check back here later to learn what { Toronto } [ Toronto ] makes of this hotly anticipated, ripped-from-the-headlines drama."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170216223112/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/30955902": "Media playback is not supported on this deviceThis story contains language you may find offensive.But the { American } [ United States ] icon was also a liar and a cheat, as he would finally admit during an infamous interview broadcast over two nights by { Winfrey } [ Oprah Winfrey ]'s { cable network } [ Networking cables ] {. } [ Cable television ]For some, confessing to using { performance-enhancing drugs } [ Performance-enhancing substance ] during all seven of his { Tour de France } [ Tour de France ] wins was too little, too late; for others, it was a betrayal of epic proportions.Sponsors dropped him, his { cancer } [ Cancer ] { charity } [ Charitable organization ] cut all ties, and his legal problems mounted.

The fallout has been heavy, maybe heavier than I thought. And the way I told my story, through { Oprah } [ Oprah Winfrey ], as good a job as I think she did, it was pretty brutal afterwards.\"It's been tough, it's been trying, it's required some patience, but it seems like there's some light at the end of the tunnel.\"DR: You said brutal, heavy, worse than expected - what did you expect?LA: \"In my mind, it felt that the air had already been let out of the balloon because of the report, the testimonies, books, because of a lot of things. So I felt most of it is out there. But I think the moment, especially here in the { United States } [ United States ], when { Americans } [ United States ] heard me say it, it was tough.Media playback is not supported on this device\"The { Oprah } [ Oprah Winfrey ] piece was for half of the audience too much: 'What? Doping, blood-boosting drug { EPO } [ Erythropoietin ] and { blood transfusions } [ Blood transfusion ]?' It was too much for them.\"The other half thought: 'That's not enough, he stopped short, he didn't name names.' So you had these two sides who were both unhappy, which makes the whole room unhappy.\"DR: Would you do it differently if you could do it again?LA: \"Yeah, definitely, upon reflection I would have just waited. I just wasn't ready to sit in that chair. There were other reasons as to why I did it - I'm not a patient person. I felt like { Oprah } [ Oprah Winfrey ] was the right chair to sit across from. But it probably needed another three to six months. but maybe not, hindsight is perfect.\"None of it was going to be well accepted. People were mad and upset, and I get that, the buck stops with me.\"DR: If you were the man on the street, a cycling fan, would you forgive { Lance Armstrong } [ Lance Armstrong ] now?LA: \"Well, that's really not fair. Listen, I'm not going to lie to you, selfishly I would say: 'Yeah, we're getting close to that time.'\"But that's me, my word doesn't matter anymore. What matters is ultimately what collectively those people on the street - whether that's the { cycling } [ Cycling ] community, the { cancer } [ Cancer ] community - it matters what they think.\"Listen, of course I want to be out of timeout, what kid doesn't?\"DR: Don't you have the keys to your own redemption? If you could just say what people want you to say, tell the full story, co-operate, that's there for you.LA: \"OK, but just to go back to whether it's time. If I were looking at somebody, and I looked at the whole story and say: 'I don't like that this guy lied to me, that he doped. I don't like that era that he raced in, I don't like any of it.'\"I would also have to think, like I would with anybody who's been in this situation: 'What else is part of this story? Is that all there was for them? Did they just have a sporting career and make a lot of money, or was there another side of it that I'm just not remembering, or honouring, or thinking about?'\"I spent a long time trying to build up an organisation the Lance Armstrong Foundation that changed its name to Livestrong after his confession to help a lot of people. And I can't lie, it hurts that that has been put away, or almost forgotten, and almost, in some parts of the world, discounted as if it was a sham or PR. It wasn't. That was very real. It meant a lot to me. And the deepest cut was Livestrong saying, 'you need to step away'.\"DR: How much did that hurt?LA: \"It doesn't get worse than that. But we are where we are. { \"DR } [ Robert Redfield ]: There's no chance of reuniting with them, that's gone forever? {LA } [ Larry Flynt ]: \"Forever is a big word. I'm not going anywhere.\"DR: And the best chance of helping people would be to have your lifetime ban reduced? What would that enable you to do?LA: \"It would reduce my boredom!\"The ban doesn't have anything to do with Livestrong or my ability to work in the cancer community. Perhaps it speeds it up. I don't know the examples in { Great Britain } [ Great Britain ] of { athletes } [ Athlete ] who have fallen. I know the examples in the { United States } [ United States ] - the { Tiger Woods } [ Tiger Woods ], the  { Michael Vicks } [ Michael Vicks ], even the { Bill Clintons } [ Bill Clinton ] - people who are still out there able to work.

And I think in most people's minds, even if it's unrealistic to them, it's one that I left myself with no choice on.\"Not all of that is true - there's a lot people don't know - but let's just say they think it's something I brought on myself. So I don't think that's the key to { forgiveness } [ Forgiveness ] {. } [ Forgiveness ]\"And we all want to be forgiven. There's a lot of really, really bad people who want to be forgiven but will never be forgiven, and I might be in that camp. But it seems like people are thinking: 'OK, we've been through this for two years, we've heard all the stories, and it looks like we're going to hear even more stories with the report out of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission. I get it, { he } [ George Harrison ] did that, they all did that. How's that? Some guys get no punishment, some get six months, he got life, how does that add up?'\"Ultimately, and I'm speaking as somebody else: 'I watched seven { Tours } [ Tour de France ], I watched them, I kind of see who won, yet he didn't win, nobody won, the sport is left with no winner, seven empty yellows, and yet the same years you have green jerseys from { Erik Zabel } [ Erik Zabel ] who's fully admitted doping, polka-dots from { Richard Virenque } [ Richard Virenque ] who's fully admitted. how does this?'

If I'm not the winner\u2026 I think there has to be a winner. I'm just saying that as a fan.\"If you go to Wikipedia and you look at the { Tour de France } [ Tour de France ], there's this huge block in { World War One } [ World War I ] with no winners, and there's another block in { World War Two } [ World War II ]. There has to be a winner.\"But I'm not trying to, you know, puff myself up. It was an unfortunate time. It was a terrible time, an imperfect storm\u2026 there needs to be a winner.\"I don't think { history } [ History ] is stupid. I can tell you { history } [ History ] isn't stupid. History ultimately rectifies a lot of these things. If you had to ask me what I think happens in 50 years, I don't think it sits empty in 50 years. Maybe somebody else's name is there. But you can't leave it empty.\"DR: Do you think you've been made a scapegoat?LA: \"Well, my actions and reactions, and the way I treated certain scenarios, were way out of line, so I deserved some punishment. Has it gone too far? Of course I'm going to say yes. But a lot of people will say it hasn't gone far enough.\"DR: You mentioned boredom - how big a problem is that now you can't compete?LA: \"Well, I compete every day on a very bad level on the { golf } [ Golf ] course!\"It's frustrating in the sense that I still think I could be competing at some { sport } [ Sport ] at a fairly high level, which nobody cares about. Nobody wants to hear me say that. And not just run, I couldn't walk it, run a little bit, walk the aid stations and finish in four hours 15 minutes, but raise a hundred grand - I can't do it.\"DR: And that's wrong?LA: \"I don't know how anyone thinks that's right. I don't think anybody thinks that's right, if { Lance Armstrong } [ Lance Armstrong ] wanted to go do a ping-pong tournament, or a broomball tournament, or an archery meet, or a swim meet for fun.\"Meanwhile, where are all the other players in the story?\"I get it, I need to be punished, but we got to look at the whole. Don't we have to look at the whole play?\"DR: The critics would say you were the ringleader. It wasn't just the { doping } [ Doping in sport ], it was the { bullying } [ Bullying ], the { intimidation } [ Intimidation ], the lying, betraying friends.LA: \"And some of that's true; some of that's not true. There was certainly a dishonesty there that I think is totally regrettable and inexcusable. The ringleading, the bullying: not totally true.\"DR: But you didn't co-operate with { Usada } [ Usada (manga artist) ] and others did. Had you done so maybe you would have got a two-year ban or a six-month ban, who knows? We don't know because you didn't co-operate.LA: \"And that is a great question. And what { Usada } [ Usada (cycling team) ] chief executive { Travis Tygart } [ Travis Tygart ] would tell you, what { Usada } [ Usada (cycling team) ] would tell you, what we have all heard a thousand times, is: 'We gave { Lance Armstrong } [ Lance Armstrong ] the same opportunity as everyone else.'\"But if you go ask former team-mates { George Hincapie } [ George Hincapie ], { Christian Vande Velde } [ Christian Vande Velde ], { Dave Zabriskie } [ Dave Zabriskie ], { Tom Danielson } [ Tom Danielson ], any of them, they're going to tell you how it went.

All I will say is that whatever they asked, I answered.\"But the tricky thing for them is they don't have real power to compel people to come, to compel people to answer certain questions.

I keep doing what I said I was going to do, and I am fine with that, I should be doing that.\"DR: When it comes to the { doping } [ Doping in sport ], would you do it again?LA: \"It's a complicated question, and my answer is not a popular answer.

I would want to change the man that did those things, maybe not the decision, but the way he acted. The way he treated other people, the way he just couldn't stop fighting. It was great to fight in training, great to fight in the race, but you don't need to fight in a { press conference } [ News conference ], or an { interview } [ Interview ], or a personal interaction.  { I } [ I (1996 film) ]'d be fighting with { you } [ You (1996 film) ] right now - { I } [ I (1996 film) ] would be taking { you } [ You (1996 film) ] on.\"That's the man that really needed to change and can never come back. So it's not an easy question, and I want to be honest with you. It's not a popular answer, but what really needed to change was the way that guy acted.\"DR: Look at the yellow jerseys on the walls of { Armstrong } [ Lance Armstrong ]'s bike shop, Mellow Johnny's. { Do you still maintain } [ Do you still maintain ] it was a level playing field?LA: \"I think that, but the better voices to answer that are the guys I raced with.

By law, no more than three of the six { members } [ Member of parliament ] of the { commission } [ Government agency ] can be { members } [ Member of parliament ] of the same { political party } [ Political party ].During an { election } [ Election ] period, the { commission } [ Government agency ] collects and publishes lists of contributions to all the official { candidates } [ Candidate ], as well as their { campaign } [ Political campaign ] spending.Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA): First implemented in 1971, the Federal Election Campaign Act is a { US } [ United States ] { federal law } [ Federal law ] that provides for the disclosure of financial contributions to federal campaigns and regulates contributions.In 1974, the law was toughened and new amendments established strict disclosure requirements for campaign donations, set specific limits for those donations, instituted public financing of presidential elections, and established the { Federal Election Commission } [ Federal Election Commission (Germany) ] (FEC) to govern the whole process.Subsequently, many of the restrictions on { campaign } [ Political campaign ] spending and contributions have been pared back in a series of { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] decisions.Filibuster: A { parliamentary } [ Parliament ] technique of delaying a vote to pass { legislation } [ Legislation ] by giving a long speech.In current practice, the minority party needs only to threaten a { filibuster } [ Filibuster ] to block legislation, because the majority party typically holds less than the 60 votes needed to end debate on a bill and move to a final vote.One of the most infamous uses of the { filibuster } [ Filibuster ] came in 1957, when { South Carolina } [ South Carolina ] { Democrat } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] { Strom Thurmond } [ Strom Thurmond ] gave a 24-hour tirade against a piece of civil rights legislation, in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to block it.Founding fathers: An imprecise term used most often to describe those involved in drafting the { Declaration of Independence } [ United States Declaration of Independence ] from { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] in 1776 and the framing and adoption of the { constitution } [ Constitution of the United States ] at the { Philadelphia Convention } [ Constitutional Convention (United States) ] of 1787.The term is sometimes also used to include influential figures in the struggle for { independence } [ Independence ] and those who fought the { Revolutionary War } [ American Revolutionary War ] {. } [ Revolutionary ]Front-loading: The tendency, which has become more marked in recent years, for { states } [ U.S. state ] to move their { primaries } [ United States presidential primary ] and { caucuses } [ Caucus ] forward, in an attempt to be among the first { states } [ U.S. state ] holding a nominating contest.State authorities believe that coming at the front of the queue increases their influence on the nomination process. However, if too many { states } [ U.S. state ] hold their contests in a short space of time, critics argue, candidates are unable to connect with voters in each individual { state } [ U.S. state ] {. } [ List of states and territories of the United States ]A side-effect is that the process starts earlier in the year and is drawn out over a longer period.Gaffe: A verbal error or slip-up made by a { politician } [ Politician ] or other { political figure } [ Politician ]. Or in a famous formulation by { American } [ United States ] journalist { Michael Kinsley } [ Michael Kinsley ], a gaffe is when a { politician } [ Politician ] accidentally says something he or she really means but that was better left unsaid.Gerrymandering: The practice of drawing political { constituency } [ Electoral district ] maps to increase a particular { candidate } [ Candidate ] {'s } [ Socialist Party of Canada ] or { party } [ Socialist Party of Canada ] {'s } [ Socialist Party of Canada ] advantage in a subsequent { election } [ Election ].In its rawest form, { gerrymandering } [ Gerrymandering ] is when { politicians } [ Politician ] choose their voters, rather than voters choosing their { politicians } [ Politician ].In the { US } [ United States ], political { district } [ District ] maps are typically redrawn once a { decade } [ Decade ] following the completion of the { census } [ Census ].The party in power in a { state } [ States and union territories of India ] government uses sophisticated mapping and statistical data to redraw the map to ensure its candidates have the best chance of success, usually by diluting the electoral strength of the opposition party's supporters.One mechanism might involve splitting a { city } [ City ] into two or more { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] districts, each of which is then dominated by { suburban } [ Suburb ] voters.Governor: The elected official of a { state } [ U.S. state ] who is responsible for the effective and efficient workings of its { government } [ Government ] {. } [ Government ]A { governor } [ Governor (United States) ] {'s } [ Governor (United States) ] term of office lasts for four years. The number of times a { governor } [ Governor (United States) ] can be re-elected varies from { state } [ U.S. state ] to { state } [ U.S. state ] {. } [ Governor (United States) ]Grand Old Party (GOP): The traditional nickname for the { Republican Party } [ Republican Party (United States) ] widely used in { American } [ United States ] political reporting.The party's official history traces the term back to the late 19th Century citing an article in the { Boston Post } [ The Boston Post ] headlined: The { GOP } [ Republican Party (United States) ] Doomed.The party website suggests the term may have evolved from the term used to refer to { British } [ United Kingdom ] { Prime Minister } [ Prime minister ] { William Gladstone } [ William Ewart Gladstone ] - the Grand Old Man.In { Richard Nixon } [ Richard Nixon ] {'s } [ Republican Party (United States) ] 1964 presidential campaign, the GOP was used briefly as the basis for the slogan the \"Go-Party\", but by the late 1970s it had become firmly associated with the term Grand Old Party.Hanging chad: A chad is the small piece of waste paper or card created when a hole is punched in a ballot.Chads became famous in the { 2000 presidential election } [ 2000 United States presidential election ], when the results in { Florida } [ Florida ] were so close that a { recount } [ Election recount ] was necessary and electoral officials were forced to examine the ballot papers to determine voters' intentions.In other cases, an indentation had been made in the { ballot } [ Ballot ] but it had not been punched through (a pregnant or dimpled chad).Hard money: Money contributed by an individual directly to a particular campaign.Individuals can currently contribute $2,500 to a candidate's { primary } [ Primary election ] campaign, and an additional $2,500 to a candidate's { general election } [ General election ] campaign. They can make these { donations } [ Donation ] to multiple { candidates } [ Candidate ].The first $250 an individual donates to a candidate's primary campaign can be matched dollar-for-dollar from federal matching funds.Limits on state-wide { elections } [ Election ] vary according to { state } [ U.S. state ] laws.The { House } [ House of Representatives ] of Representatives: The { House } [ House of Representatives ] is the larger of the two houses of { Congress } [ United States Congress ] which are the law-making branches of government.The 435 members of the { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] - generally known as { Congressmen } [ United States House of Representatives ] and { Congresswomen } [ United States House of Representatives ] - serve two-year terms.The presiding member, the { speaker } [ Speaker (politics) ] of the { house } [ United States House of Representatives ], is elected by a majority vote of members of the { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] at the beginning of each new { Congress } [ United States Congress ].House members each represent approximately half-a-million citizens in their districts. The number of { districts } [ Electoral district ] for each { state } [ States and territories of Australia ] is determined each decade by a { proportional } [ Proportional representation ] allocation based on the { federal } [ Federation ] census.Unlike the { speaker } [ Speaker (politics) ], he or she has no responsibility for the House as a whole, and focuses purely on advancing the interests of his or her { party } [ Political party ] - for example, by organising members to support the { party } [ Political party ] {'s } [ Party ] policy agenda.House Minority Leader: The leader of the minority party in the { House of Representatives } [ United States House of Representatives ] {. } [ United States House of Representatives ]He or she acts as a { spokesperson } [ Spokesperson ] for the minority party's policy position and organises its legislative strategy.In practice, the { minority leader } [ Minority leader ] has very little legislative influence, because the { House } [ House of Representatives ] rules essentially allow the { majority } [ Majority ] party to pass { bills } [ Bill (law) ] unilaterally.Inauguration: The { ceremony } [ Ceremony ] that marks the start of the new { president } [ President of the United States ]'s { term of office } [ Term of office ] {. } [ Term of office ] Under the { US constitution } [ Constitution of the United States ], this happens on 20 January of the year following the { election } [ Election ] {. } [ United States presidential election ]Independent: Registered voters who have not declared a party affiliation.Because most voters registered for a particular { party } [ Political party ] will vote for that { party } [ Political party ] {'s } [ Socialist Party of America ] candidate, { general election } [ General election ] campaigns have tended to focus on winning over these groups.Nationwide about a third of all voters consider themselves { independent } [ Independent politician ], but some key { states } [ U.S. state ] have a higher proportion of { independent } [ Independent politician ] voters than others. { New Hampshire } [ New Hampshire ], for example, traditionally has a large number of { independents } [ Independent politician ] and as a result has a reputation for producing unexpected results during its { primary } [ Primary election ] elections.Libertarian: A voter whose concerns are driven by belief in a { small government } [ Small government ], fierce support for { fiscal conservative } [ Fiscal conservatism ] ideas and notions of individual liberty.US { libertarians } [ Libertarianism ] tend to vote { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ], attracted to the party's advocacy for lower taxes and government spending and opposition to regulation of business and to the { welfare state } [ Welfare state ].But many { libertarians } [ Libertarianism ] disagree with the party's stances on { social issues } [ Social issue ] and the { war on drugs } [ War on drugs ] {. } [ War on drugs ]For example, while opposition to { same-sex marriage } [ Same-sex marriage ] is a key plank in the national { Republican Party } [ Republican Party (United States) ] platform, staunch { libertarian } [ Libertarianism ] voters might argue the government has no business restricting two individuals' right to enter into a marriage compact.In { 2008 } [ 2008 United States presidential election ] and { 2012 } [ 2012 United States presidential election ], { libertarians } [ Libertarianism ] have backed { Ron Paul } [ Ron Paul ]'s candidacy for the { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] nomination.Lobbyist: A person hired to represent the interests of a company, industry, political cause or foreign government in the { Congress } [ United States Congress ], regulatory agencies or other parts of the { US } [ United States ] government.Effective { lobbyists } [ Lobbying ] are very well-connected and are often former members of { Congress } [ United States Congress ] or the { Congressional } [ United States Congress ] staff or had other high-level jobs in the US government.On the campaign trail, cosy connections with { lobbyists } [ Lobbying ] - or worse, a background advocating for paid clients - can be a liability.In the 2012 race, { Newt Gingrich } [ Newt Gingrich ] had to defend himself against allegations he took millions of dollars over the past decade to advocate on behalf of healthcare companies and a government-sponsored mortgage company.McCain-Feingold: A 2002 campaign finance reform law named after its main sponsors, { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] Senator { John McCain } [ John McCain ] of { Arizona } [ Arizona ] and { Wisconsin } [ Wisconsin ] { Democrat } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] { Russ Feingold } [ Russ Feingold ].The law was designed to limit the system of { fundraising } [ Fundraising ] and { corporate } [ Corporation ] spending in federal election campaigns that existed outside the highly regulated infrastructure of public funding and hard money contributions to political candidates.Much of the law was subsequently overturned by the { US Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ], which found restrictions on corporate spending in elections to be an { unconstitutional } [ Constitutionality ] infringement on { freedom of speech } [ Freedom of speech ].Among the parts that remain intact are a ban on unlimited soft money donations to national political parties.Medicaid: A { health insurance } [ Health insurance ] programme for the poor and some disabled people that is funded jointly by the { states } [ States and territories of Australia ] and the { federal government } [ Federal government of Australia ] and administered at the { state } [ States and territories of Australia ] level.It is up to { states } [ States and territories of Australia ] to determine matters of coverage, eligibility and the administration of the programme, but they must conform to broad { federal } [ Federalism ] guidelines.Medicare: The national { health insurance } [ Health insurance ] programme designed to help protect people aged 65 and over from the high costs of { healthcare } [ Health care ] {. } [ Health insurance ]National convention: The party assembly held every four years at which { state } [ States of Brazil ] delegates from across the country gather to nominate the party's candidates for { president } [ President of Brazil ] and { vice-president } [ Vice President of Brazil ].The nominees are typically chosen by party voters in { primary elections } [ Primary election ] and { caucuses } [ Caucus ] well ahead of the { conventions } [ United States presidential convention ], but the formal convention processes remain in place in case the decision over the party's candidate has to be brokered by the various party leaders.In { 1924 } [ 1924 United States presidential election ], a bitterly divided { Democratic Party } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] took 103 ballots to decide on their { presidential } [ President of the United States ] candidate.Oval Office: The office traditionally occupied by the { president } [ President of the United States ] in the { West Wing } [ West Wing ] of the { White House } [ White House ].The term is often used to describe the { presidency } [ President of the United States ] itself, and the physical proximity of aides to the { Oval Office } [ Oval Office ] is seen as reflecting the extent of their influence.In addition to the { Oval Office } [ Oval Office ] {, } [ List of Presidents of the United States ] the { president } [ President of the United States ] keeps a private study next door.Political Action Committee (Pac): An organisation formed to promote its members' views on selected issues, usually by raising money that is used to fund candidates who support the group's position.Pacs monitor candidates' voting records and question them on their beliefs on issues of interest to their membership.Because { federal } [ Federal government of the United States ] law restricts the amount of money an individual, { corporation } [ Corporation ] or { union } [ Trade union ] can give to candidates, Pacs have become an important way of funnelling large funds into the political process and influencing { elections } [ Election ].Pork barrel politics: The appropriation of { government spending } [ Government spending ] - or pork - pursued by a lawmaker for projects that benefit his or her { constituents } [ Electoral district ] or { campaign contributors } [ Campaign finance ].Primary: A state-level { election } [ Election ] held to nominate a { party } [ Political party ] {'s } [ Political party ] candidate for office. Regulations governing them and the dates on which they are held vary from { state } [ U.S. state ] to { state } [ U.S. state ] {. } [ List of states and territories of the United States ]In some { states } [ U.S. state ], voters are restricted to choosing candidates only from the party for which they have registered support, however 29 { states } [ U.S. state ] permit { open primaries } [ Primary election ] in which a voter may opt to back a candidate regardless of their nominal affiliation. In this case, { strategic voting } [ Strategic voting ] may take place with, for example, { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] crossing over to back the perceived weaker { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] candidate.Primaries first emerged as a result of the so-called { progressive } [ Progressivism ] movement of the early 20th Century, which argued that leaving the nomination process purely to { party } [ Political party ] bosses was inherently undemocratic.Pro-choice: The term used for those who support a woman's right to choose abortion if she so wishes.Most { pro-choice } [ Abortion-rights movements ] politicians will usually seek to avoid the emotive issue of { abortion } [ Abortion ] itself, following instead the { libertarian } [ Libertarianism ] line that government has no place interfering in what should be a private decision.The { Democratic Party } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] has been broadly supportive of the { pro-choice } [ Abortion-rights movements ] movement. { President } [ President of the United States ] { Bill Clinton } [ Bill Clinton ] summed up his party's stance by saying { abortions } [ Abortion ] should be \"safe, legal and rare\".Pro-life: The term used to describe politicians and pressure groups opposed to { abortion } [ Abortion ] or allowing women to opt for { abortion } [ Abortion ] {. } [ Abortion ]Some { American } [ United States ] advocates of the { pro-life } [ Anti-abortion movement ] position believe abortion should only be allowed in cases where a pregnancy results from { rape } [ Rape ] or { incest } [ Incest ]. Others believe that { abortion } [ Abortion ] should be ruled out altogether.The 1973 { Roe v Wade } [ Roe v. Wade ] decision by the { US Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ], which in effect legalised { abortion in the US } [ Abortion in the United States ], is viewed by { pro-life } [ Anti-abortion movement ] supporters as in contravention of the fundamental rights of the unborn child.A more recent decision, { Planned Parenthood v Casey } [ Planned Parenthood v. Casey ] in 1992, allowed { states } [ U.S. state ] to limit access to { abortion } [ Abortion ] so long as they do not place an \"undue burden\".Since then, { conservative } [ Conservatism ] states have placed dramatic restrictions on { abortion } [ Abortion ] - for example, by enacting waiting periods between an initial consultation with the provider and the actual procedure, or by requiring doctors to inform pregnant women about the appearance and characteristics of the foetus.Public funding: Money supplied to campaigns from government coffers and administered by the { Federal Election Commission } [ Federal Election Commission ] {. } [ Federal Election Commission ]This includes { primary election } [ Primary election ] matching funds, which match the money candidates have raised privately, and a grant for the { general election } [ General election ], and grants to fund the major parties' { conventions } [ Political convention ].Presidential candidates who accept public funding must agree to spending limits. In the { general election } [ General election ], candidates who accept public funds may not raise private money in addition to the { grant } [ Grant (money) ], nor can they spend more than the { grant } [ Grant (money) ] (though some legal and accounting expenses and some of candidates' personal cash is exempt).In 2008, Mr { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] became the first candidate to decline public funds for the general election because he calculated he could raise more on his own and did not want to be held to a $84.1m spending limit - including what he had already raised privately. Also, he feared attack from well-funded independent { conservative } [ Conservatism ] groups not subject to spending limits.To qualify for primary election matching funds, candidates need to raise at least $100,000 in individual donations, including at least $5,000 from 20 different states.Candidates who fail to receive at least 10% of the popular vote in two successive { primary } [ Primary election ] elections lose their eligibility for continued payments, unless and until they receive at least 20% of the vote in a later { primary } [ Primary election ].The two major parties - the { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] and { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] - are automatically entitled to a public grant to pay for the cost of their national conventions. Minor parties are also entitled to a smaller subsidy in proportion to the vote they received. New parties are not eligible. A state which could vote { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] (blue) or { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] (red).Push polling: The controversial practice where voters are contacted over the telephone by people who are ostensibly taking a poll, but who talk up their own candidate and rubbish opponents.Reagan Democrat: Working-class { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] voter who defected from the party to vote for { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] candidate { Ronald Reagan } [ Ronald Reagan ] in the { 1980 } [ 1980 United States presidential election ] and { 1984 } [ 1984 United States presidential election ] presidential elections.The term is also used these days to denote moderate { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] who are more { conservative } [ Conservatism in the United States ] than other { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] on issues such as { national security } [ National security ] or { immigration } [ Immigration ].Red { state } [ U.S. state ]: A { state } [ U.S. state ] where people tend to vote for the { Republican Party } [ Republican Party (United States) ] {. } [ Republican Party (United States) ]Roe v Wade: The landmark 1973 { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] judgement that prohibited { states } [ U.S. state ] from banning { abortion } [ Abortion ].The court's ruling was based on the concept that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy came under the freedom of personal choice in family matters as protected by the { Fourteenth Amendment } [ Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ].The decision remains one of the most controversial ever made by the { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ].While states are prohibited from barring { abortion } [ Abortion ] outright, they have been allowed under subsequent { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] rulings to restrict certain types of { abortion } [ Abortion ] and place often onerous requirements on doctors who provide { abortion } [ Abortion ] and women seeking them.Running mate: The { presidential } [ President of the United States ] nominee's candidate for the { vice-presidency } [ Vice President of the United States ] {. } [ Vice President of the United States ]The text reads: \"A well-regulated { militia } [ Militia ] being necessary to the protection of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"The wording is open to interpretation and as a result it has become the focus of fierce debate between supporters and opponents of gun control.Gun control opponents such as the { National Rifle Association } [ National Rifle Association ] argue that the amendment gives { Americans } [ United States ] the constitutional right to bear arms free from any form of government control. But advocates of { gun control } [ Gun control ] argue the amendment was only written to guarantee the right to bear arms as part of a collective { militia } [ Militia ], and say { states } [ U.S. state ] and { municipalities } [ Municipality ] should be able to restrict gun ownership and use.Senate: The { upper house } [ Upper house ] of { Congress } [ United States Congress ], although members of the other house - the { House of Representatives } [ United States House of Representatives ] - traditionally regard it as an equal body.The { Senate } [ Australian Senate ] has 100 elected members, two from each { state } [ U.S. state ], serving six-year terms with one-third of the seats coming up for election every two years. The vice-president serves as the { presiding officer } [ Speaker (politics) ] over the { Senate } [ United States Senate ], although he or she does not serve on any { committees } [ United States congressional committee ] and is restricted to voting only in the event of a tie.Senate Majority Leader: The leader of the majority party in the { Senate } [ United States Senate ], and the most powerful member of the { upper house } [ Upper house ] of { Congress } [ United States Congress ] {. } [ United States Congress ]He or she controls the daily { legislative } [ Legislature ] programme and decides on the time allowed for { debates } [ Debate ].Senate Minority Leader: The leader of the minority party in the Senate.He or she acts as a { figurehead } [ Figurehead ] for the minority party in the { Senate } [ United States Senate ], articulating its policy positions and attempting to deliver its legislative priorities. Each { US } [ United States ] { state } [ U.S. state ] has two (a junior and a senior { senator } [ United States Senate ], distinguished by length of service).Before { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ], the last time a senator was directly elected to the { White House } [ White House ] was in 1960, when { John F Kennedy } [ John F. Kennedy ] won the { presidency } [ President of the United States ].Speaker of the House: The leader of the majority party in the { House of Representatives } [ United States House of Representatives ] - not to be confused with the House Majority Leader.The { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] { Speaker } [ Speaker (politics) ] has a dual role as both the leader of his or her party in the { House } [ United States House of Representatives ], and as the presiding officer in the chamber, with responsibility for controlling debate and setting the legislative agenda.Under the terms of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the speaker is the second in line to the { presidency } [ President of the United States ] after the { vice-president } [ Vice President of the United States ].Stump { speech } [ Public speaking ]: A { candidate } [ Candidate ]'s routine { speech } [ Public speaking ] outlining his or her core { campaign } [ Political campaign ] message.The phrase stems from the days when { candidates } [ Candidate ] would make { speeches } [ Public speaking ] standing on tree stumps. Campaigning { politicians } [ Politician ] are still said to be on the stump.For example, for an amendment to be added to the { US constitution } [ Constitution of the United States ], it must be approved by a { supermajority } [ Supermajority ] of two-thirds in both houses of { Congress } [ United States Congress ] and the legislatures of three fourths of the { states } [ U.S. state ].In the { Senate } [ United States Senate ], a { supermajority } [ Supermajority ] of 60% is required to end a debate on a { bill } [ Bill (law) ]. In recent years, the minority party party has forced the { senate } [ United States Senate ] to require a { supermajority } [ Supermajority ] to pass almost all substantive legislation, contributing to political gridlock in { Washington } [ Washington (state) ] {. } [ Washington (state) ]This gridlock is expected to be an issue in the { 2012 presidential campaign } [ 2012 United States presidential election ], with Mr { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] and the { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] accusing { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] of using parliamentary manoeuvres to obstruct progress.SuperPac: A category of independent political action group established by the { Citizens United } [ Citizens United v. FEC ] { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] decision that is allowed to accept and spend unlimited amounts of corporate, individual or union cash on behalf of a candidate, often without disclosing its sources.SuperPacs are barred from co-ordinating their spending - usually on { advertising } [ Advertising ] - with the { candidates } [ Candidate ] they support, but some say they in essence operate as shadow campaign committees. See entries on { Citizens United } [ Citizens United (organization) ] and soft money.Super Tuesday: The day in the campaign calendar, usually in February or early March of an { election } [ Election ] year, when a large number of { states } [ U.S. state ] hold { primary } [ Primary election ] { elections } [ Elections in the United States ].The first { Super Tuesday } [ Super Tuesday ] occurred in the 1988 campaign, when southern state party officials hoped that by holding their votes on the same day they would increase the influence of the { South } [ Southern United States ] and downplay the importance of the earlier { New Hampshire } [ New Hampshire ] primaries and { Iowa } [ Iowa ] caucuses.Since then a number of other states have chosen to hold their { primaries } [ United States presidential primary ] on the same day, including { California } [ California ] {. } [ California ]Swing states: States in which the electorate is relatively evenly split between { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] and { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ], making them targets for aggressive campaigning by both sides.In recent elections, the most important swing states were { Florida } [ Florida ], { Ohio } [ Ohio ] and { Pennsylvania } [ Pennsylvania ] {. } [ Pennsylvania ]In the { 2008 } [ 2008 United States presidential election ] election, for instance, historically { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] { Virginia } [ Virginia ] and { North Carolina } [ North Carolina ] voted for { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ], anticipating their status as hard-fought swing states in 2012.Tea Party: A populist { conservative } [ Conservatism in the United States ] movement known for its uncompromising stance on fiscal issues, its disdain for Mr { Obama } [ Barack Obama ], and the stridency of its rhetoric.The { Tea Party movement } [ Tea Party movement ] arose in spring 2009 in opposition to Mr { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] agenda, in particular his struggle to reform the US healthcare system.Its primary demands are drastic cuts in { government spending } [ Government spending ] and { taxes } [ Tax ].The { movement } [ Social movement ] {'s } [ Socialist Party of Germany ] record { of } [ Socialist Party of Germany ] political success has been mixed {. } [ Socialist Party of Germany ]Tea Party activists, supported with funding and organising assistance from well-heeled { conservative } [ Conservatism in the United States ] backers, elected a class of fiscal { conservative } [ Conservatism in the United States ] freshmen { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] to the { House of Representatives } [ United States House of Representatives ] in 2010.But their insistence on ideological purity has yielded some { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] candidates who are unpalatable to the broader electorate.And { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] blame the { Tea Party movement } [ Tea Party movement ] for much of the { Republican Party } [ Republican Party (United States) ]'s inability and unwillingness to compromise on tax increases they say are needed to reduce the US budget deficit.It is named after a series of colonial-era protests in which { American } [ United States ] revolutionaries dumped { British } [ United Kingdom ] tea into the sea to protest against a tea tax.Third-party candidate: A candidate who does not belong to one of the two main { US } [ United States ] { political parties } [ Political party ], the { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] or the { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ].Examples of third-party candidates who are running in 2016 are { Libertarian } [ Libertarian Party (United States) ] { Gary Johnson } [ Gary Johnson ] and { Green Party } [ Green Party of the United States ]'s { Jill Stein } [ Jill Stein ]. In 1992, it's unclear if { Ross Perot } [ Ross Perot ] took votes away from incumbent { George HW Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] and helped { Bill Clinton } [ Bill Clinton ] to victory. In 2000, { Green Party } [ Green Party of the United States ] candidate { Ralph Nader } [ Ralph Nader ] is believed to have siphoned votes from { Democrat } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] { Al Gore } [ Al Gore ].Ticket: Usually preceded by the name of a { party } [ Political party ], the \"ticket\" refers to the { candidates } [ Candidate ] running together. Candidates for the { presidency } [ President of the United States ] and { vice presidency } [ Vice President of the United States ] run on the same \"ticket\".Trump University: A { higher education } [ Higher education ] institution founded by { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and two associates specialising in real-estate and asset-management education that operated from 2005 to 2010. It has been the subject of a { New York } [ New York City ] state investigations for illegal business practices and two lawsuits alleging { fraud } [ Fraud ] {. } [ Fraud ] The legal proceedings are ongoing.Vice-President: The presiding officer of the { US Senate } [ United States Senate ] and the person who assumes the office of the president in the event of the resignation, removal, incapacitation or death of the incumbent president.The { vice-president } [ Vice President of the United States ] only casts a vote in the { Senate } [ United States Senate ] in the event of a tie.Although those are the only duties the { US constitution } [ Constitution of the United States ] enumerates for the office, the { vice-president } [ Vice President of the United States ] can amass significant informal power in his capacity as an adviser to the { president } [ President of the United States ] {. } [ President of the United States ]Early vice-presidents had little else in the way of official responsibilities.In 1885 { Woodrow Wilson } [ Woodrow Wilson ], who would later become { president } [ President of the United States ], commented that there was \"little to be said about the { vice-president } [ Vice President of the United States ] {. } [ Vice President of the United States ] { His } [ George VI ] importance consists in the fact that { he } [ George VI ] may cease to be { vice-president } [ Vice president ] {\". } [ George VI ]In recent years, though, vice-presidents have taken on an increasingly prominent role managing a range of high-profile { foreign } [ Foreign policy ] and { domestic policy } [ Domestic policy ] programmes.Dick { Cheney } [ Dick Cheney ], who served under { George W Bush } [ George W. Bush ], is considered the most powerful { vice-president } [ Vice President of the United States ] in { US } [ United States ] history.Wedge issue: An issue on which a { candidate } [ Candidate ] campaigns in order to divide factions within his opponent's supporter base.For example, in 2004 { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] proposed { same-sex marriage } [ Same-sex marriage ] bans in more than a dozen states and { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] candidates loudly trumpeted their support.The subsequent referenda were aimed at attracting voters who support the { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] on most { economic } [ Economy ] issues but who feel strongly about { social } [ Social ] issues.Conversely, { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] might highlight their more { liberal } [ Liberalism in the United States ] position on abortion, in an attempt to win over { pro-choice } [ Abortion-rights movements ] { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ].Wonk: A { political figure } [ Politician ] or { pundit } [ Pundit ] seen as having a studied and detailed command of { public policy } [ Public

} [ United States ], { Australia } [ Australia ], { Canada } [ Canada ], { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ], countries in { Africa } [ Africa ] or those that are closer to home in { Europe } [ Europe ] - so many of us have close friends and relatives from across the world.Instinctively, we want to travel to, study in, trade with countries not just in { Europe } [ Europe ] but beyond the borders of our continent.Even now as we prepare to leave the { EU } [ European Union ], we are planning for the next biennial { Commonwealth } [ Commonwealth of Nations ] Heads of Government meeting in 2018 - a reminder of our unique and proud .And it is important to recognise this fact: 23 June was not the moment { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] chose to step back from the world.It was the moment we chose to build a truly { global } [ Globalization ] { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]I know that this - and the other reasons { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] took such a decision - is not always well understood among our friends and allies in { Europe } [ Europe ].And I know many fear that this might herald the beginning of a greater unravelling of the EU.But let me be clear: I do not want that to happen.It would not be in the best interests of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] national interest that the { EU } [ European Union ] should succeed.And that is why I hope in the months and years ahead we will all reflect on the lessons of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s decision to leave.So let me take this opportunity to set out the reasons for our decision and to address the people of { Europe } [ Europe ] directly.It's not simply because our { history } [ History ] and { culture } [ Culture ] is profoundly { internationalist } [ Internationalism (politics) ], important though that is.Many in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] have always felt that the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] place in the { European Union } [ European Union ] came at the expense of our global ties, and of a bolder embrace of free trade with the wider world.There are other important reasons too.Our { political } [ Politics ] traditions are different.Unlike other { European } [ Europe ] countries, we have no written { constitution } [ Constitution ], but the principle of parliamentary sovereignty is the basis of our unwritten constitutional settlement.We have only a recent history of { devolved } [ Devolution ] governance - though it has rapidly embedded itself - and we have little history of { coalition } [ Coalition ] government.The public expect to be able to hold their governments to account very directly, and as a result supranational institutions as strong as those created by the { European Union } [ European Union ] sit very uneasily in relation to our political history and way of life.And, while I know { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] might at times have been seen as an awkward member state, the { European Union } [ European Union ] has struggled to deal with the diversity of its member countries and their interests.It bends towards uniformity, not flexibility.David Cameron's negotiation was a valiant final attempt to make it work for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] - and I want to thank all those elsewhere in { Europe } [ Europe ] who helped him reach an agreement - but the blunt truth, as we know, is that there was not enough flexibility on many important matters for a majority of { British } [ United Kingdom ] voters.Now I do not believe that these things apply uniquely to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]Britain is not the only member state where there is a strong attachment to accountable and democratic government, such a strong { internationalist } [ Internationalism (politics) ] mindset, or a belief that diversity within { Europe } [ Europe ] should be celebrated.And so I believe there is a lesson in { Brexit } [ Brexit ] not just for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] but, if it wants to succeed, for the { EU } [ European Union ] itself, because our continent's great strength has always been its diversity.And there are two ways of dealing with different interests.You can respond by trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect.Or you can respect difference, cherish it even, and reform the EU so that it deals better with the wonderful diversity of its member states.So to our friends across { Europe } [ Europe ] {, } [ London ] let me say this.Our vote to leave the { European Union } [ European Union ] was no rejection of the values we share.The decision to leave the { EU } [ European Union ] represents no desire to become more distant to you, our friends and neighbours.It was no attempt to do harm to the { EU } [ European Union ] itself or to any of its remaining { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ] {. } [ Member state of the European Union ]We do not want to turn the clock back to the days when { Europe } [ Europe ] was less peaceful, less secure and less able to trade freely.It was a vote to restore, as we see it, our parliamentary democracy, national self-determination, and to become even more { global } [ Globalization ] and { internationalist } [ Internationalism (politics) ] in action and in spirit.We will continue to be reliable partners, willing allies and close friends.We want to buy your goods and services, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship.You will still be welcome in this { country } [ Country ] as we hope our { citizens } [ Citizenship ] will be welcome in yours.At a time when together we face a serious threat from our enemies, { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] unique intelligence capabilities will continue to help to keep people in { Europe } [ Europe ] safe from { terrorism } [ Terrorism ].And at a time when there is growing concern about { European } [ Europe ] security, { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s servicemen and women, based in { European } [ Europe ] countries including { Estonia } [ Estonia ], { Poland } [ Poland ] and { Romania } [ Romania ], will continue to do their duty.We are leaving the { European Union } [ European Union ] {, } [ European Union ] but we are not leaving { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ European Union ]And that is why we seek a new and equal partnership - between an independent, self-governing, global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and our friends and allies in the EU, not partial membership of the { European Union } [ European Union ], associate membership of the { European Union } [ European Union ], or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out.We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries.We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.No, the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] is leaving the { European Union } [ European Union ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]And my job is to get the right deal for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] as we do.So today I want to outline our objectives for the negotiation ahead - 12 objectives that amount to one big goal: a new, positive and constructive partnership between { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { European Union } [ European Union ].And as we negotiate that { partnership } [ Partnership ], we will be driven by some simple principles: we will provide as much certainty and clarity as we can at every stage.And we will take this opportunity to make { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] stronger, to make { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] fairer, and to build a more global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] too.The first objective is crucial.We will provide certainty wherever we can.We are about to enter a { negotiation } [ Negotiation ] {. } [ Negotiation ]That means there will be give and take.There will have to be compromises.It will require imagination on both sides.And not everybody will be able to know everything at every stage.But I recognise how important it is to provide { business } [ Business ], the { public sector } [ Public sector ], and everybody with as much certainty as possible as we move through the process.So where we can offer that certainty, we will do so.That is why last year we acted quickly to give clarity about farm payments and university funding.This will give the { country } [ Country ] maximum certainty as we leave the { EU } [ European Union ] {. } [ European Union ]The same rules and laws will apply on the day after { Brexit } [ Brexit ] as they did before.And it will be for the { British } [ United Kingdom ] { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] to decide on any changes to that { law } [ Law ] after full scrutiny and proper parliamentary debate.And when it comes to { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ], there is one other way in which I would like to provide certainty.I can confirm today that the { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the { EU } [ European Union ] to a vote in both { Houses of Parliament } [ Palace of Westminster ], before it comes into force.Our second guiding principle is to build a stronger Britain.That means taking control of our own affairs, as those who voted in their millions to leave the { European Union } [ European Union ] demanded we must.So we will take back control of our laws and bring an end to the jurisdiction of the { European Court of Justice } [ European Court of Justice ] in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].Leaving the { European Union } [ European Union ] will mean that our laws will be made in { Westminster } [ Westminster ], { Edinburgh } [ Edinburgh ], { Cardiff } [ Cardiff ] and { Belfast } [ Belfast ].And those laws will be interpreted by { judges } [ Judge ] not in { Luxembourg } [ Luxembourg ] but in { courts } [ Court ] across this country.Because we will not have truly left the { European Union } [ European Union ] if we are not in control of our own laws.A stronger { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] demands that we do something else - strengthen the precious union between the four nations of the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ].At this momentous time, it is more important than ever that we face the future together, united by what makes us strong: the bonds that unite us as a people, and our shared interest in the UK being an open, successful trading nation in the future.And I hope that same spirit of unity will apply in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] in particular over the coming months in the assembly elections, and the main parties there will work together to re-establish a partnership government as soon as possible.Foreign affairs are of course the responsibility of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] government, and in dealing with them we act in the interests of all parts of the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ].As { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] {, } [ Prime Minister of Canada ] I take that responsibility seriously {. } [ Prime Minister of Canada ]I have also been determined from the start that the devolved administrations should be fully engaged in this process.That is why the government has set up a Joint Ministerial Committee on EU Negotiations, so ministers from each of the UK's devolved administrations can contribute to the process of planning for our departure from the { European Union } [ European Union ].We have already received a paper from the { Scottish } [ Scotland ] government, and look forward to receiving a paper from the { Welsh } [ Wales ] government shortly.Both { papers } [ Academic publishing ] will be considered as part of this important process.We won't agree on everything, but I look forward to working with the administrations in { Scotland } [ Scotland ], { Wales } [ Wales ] and { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] to deliver a { Brexit } [ Brexit ] that works for the whole of the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ].Part of that will mean working very carefully to ensure that - as powers are repatriated from { Brussels } [ Brussels ] back to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] - the right powers are returned to { Westminster } [ Westminster ], and the right powers are passed to the devolved administrations of { Scotland } [ Scotland ], { Wales } [ Wales ] and { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ].As we do so, our guiding principle must be to ensure that - as we leave the { European Union } [ European Union ] - no new barriers to living and doing business within our own union are created,That means maintaining the necessary common standards and frameworks for our own domestic market, empowering the UK as an open, trading nation to strike the best trade deals around the world, and protecting the common resources of our islands.And as we do this, I should equally be clear that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be removed from them.We cannot forget that, as we leave, the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] will share a land border with the { EU } [ European Union ], and maintaining that { Common Travel Area } [ Common Travel Area ] with the { Republic of Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] will be an important priority for the UK in the talks ahead.There has been a Common Travel Area between the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and the { Republic of Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] for many years.Indeed, it was formed before either of our two countries were members of the { European Union } [ European Union ].And the { family } [ Family ] ties and bonds of affection that unite our two { countries } [ Country ] mean that there will always be a special relationship between us.Nobody wants to return to the borders of the past, so we will make it a priority to deliver a practical solution as soon as we can.The third principle is to build a fairer Britain.That means ensuring it is fair to everyone who lives and works in this country.And that is why we will ensure we can control { immigration } [ Immigration ] to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] from { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]We will continue to attract the brightest and the best to work or study in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] - indeed openness to international talent must remain one of this country's most distinctive assets - but that process must be managed properly so that our immigration system serves the national interest.So we will get control of the number of people coming to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] from the { EU } [ European Union ] {. } [ European Union ]Because while controlled { immigration } [ Immigration ] can bring great benefits - filling skills shortages, delivering public services, making { British } [ United Kingdom ] businesses the world-beaters they often are - when the numbers get too high, public support for the system falters.In the last decade or so, we have seen record levels of net migration in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ], and that sheer volume has put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing, and put a downward pressure on wages for { working class } [ Working class ] people.As { home secretary } [ Home Secretary ] for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] from { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]Britain is an open and tolerant country.We will always want { immigration } [ Immigration ], especially high-skilled { immigration } [ Immigration ], we will always want { immigration } [ Immigration ] from { Europe } [ Europe ], and we will always welcome individual migrants as friends.But the message from the public before and during the { referendum } [ 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum ] campaign was clear: { Brexit } [ Brexit ] must mean control of the number of people who come to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] from { Europe } [ Europe ].And that is what we will deliver.Fairness demands that we deal with another issue as soon as possible too.We want to guarantee the rights of EU citizens who are already living in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ], and the rights of { British } [ United Kingdom ] nationals in other member states, as early as we can.I have told other { EU } [ European Union ] leaders that we could give people the certainty they want straight away, and reach such a deal now.Many of them favour such an agreement - one or two others do not - but I want everyone to know that it remains an important priority for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] - and for many other member states - to resolve this challenge as soon as possible, because it is the right and fair thing to do.And a fairer { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] is a country that protects and enhances the rights people have at work.That is why, as we translate the body of { European } [ Europe ] law into our domestic regulations, we will ensure that workers rights are fully protected and maintained.Indeed, under my leadership, not only will the government protect the rights of workers' set out in { European } [ Europe ] legislation, we will build on them.Because under this { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] government, we will make sure legal protection for workers keeps pace with the changing labour market - and that the voices of workers are heard by the boards of publicly listed companies for the first time.But the great prize for this { country } [ Country ] - the opportunity ahead - is to use this moment to build a truly { global } [ Globalization ] { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].A { country } [ Country ] that reaches out to old friends and new allies alike, a great, global, trading { nation } [ Nation ], and one of the firmest advocates for { free trade } [ Free trade ] anywhere in the { world } [ World ].That starts with our close { friends } [ Friendship ] and neighbours in { Europe } [ Europe ].So as a priority {, } [ United Kingdom ] we will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the { European Union } [ European Union ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]This agreement should allow for the freest possible trade in goods and services between { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] {'s } [ European Union ] { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ].It should give { British } [ United Kingdom ] companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate within { European } [ Europe ] markets - and let { European } [ Europe ] businesses do the same in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].But I want to be clear.And being out of the { EU } [ European Union ] but a member of the { single market } [ European Single Market ] would mean complying with the { EU } [ European Union ] {'s } [ European Union ] rules and regulations that implement those freedoms, without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are.It would mean accepting a role for the { European Court of Justice } [ European Court of Justice ] that would see it still having direct legal authority in our country.It would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all.Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement.That agreement may take in elements of current { single market } [ Single market ] arrangements in certain areas - on the export of cars and lorries for example, or the freedom to provide financial services across national borders - as it makes no sense to start again from scratch when { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the remaining { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ] have adhered to the same rules for so many years.But I respect the position taken by { European } [ Europe ] leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine.So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the { EU } [ European Union ] will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the { single market } [ Single market ], on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive { free trade } [ Free trade ] agreement.There may be some specific { European } [ Europe ] programmes in which we might want to participate.If so, and this will be for us to decide, it is reasonable that we should make an appropriate contribution.But the principle is clear: the days of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] making vast contributions to the { European Union } [ European Union ] every year will end.But it is not just trade with the { EU } [ European Union ] we should be interested in.A global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] must be free to strike trade agreements with countries from outside the { European Union } [ European Union ] too, because important though our trade with the { EU } [ European Union ] is and will remain, it is clear that the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] needs to increase significantly its trade with the fastest growing export markets in the world.That is why it is time for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to get out into the world and rediscover its role as a great, global, trading nation.We want to get out into the wider world, to { trade } [ Trade ] and { do business } [ Business ] all around the { globe } [ Globe ].Countries including { China } [ China ], { Brazil } [ Brazil ], and the { Gulf States } [ Arab states of the Persian Gulf ] have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us.We have started discussions on future trade ties with countries like { Australia } [ Australia ], { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ] and { India } [ India ].And { President-elect } [ President-elect of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has said { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] is not \"at the back of the queue\" for a trade deal with the { United States } [ United States ], the world's biggest economy, but front of the line.I know my emphasis on striking trade agreements with countries outside { Europe } [ Europe ] has led to questions about whether { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] seeks to remain a member of the EU's Customs Union.And it is true that full Customs Union membership prevents us from negotiating our own comprehensive trade deals.Now, I want { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to be able to negotiate its own trade agreements.But I also want tariff-free trade with { Europe } [ Europe ] and cross-border trade there to be as frictionless as possible.That means I do not want { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to be part of the { Common Commercial Policy } [ Common Commercial Policy ] and I do not want us to be bound by the common external tariff.These are the elements of the Customs Union that prevent us from striking our own comprehensive trade agreements with other countries.But I do want us to have a customs agreement with the { EU } [ European Union ].Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position.I have an open mind on how we do it.It is not the { means } [ Value theory ] that matter, but the { ends } [ Value theory ].And those ends are clear: I want to remove as many barriers to trade as possible.And I want { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to be free to establish our own tariff schedules at the { World Trade Organization } [ World Trade Organization ], meaning we can reach new trade agreements not just with the { European Union } [ European Union ] but with old friends and new allies from outside { Europe } [ Europe ] too.A global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] must also be a { country } [ Country ] that looks to the { future } [ Future ].That means being one of the best places in the world for { science } [ Science ] and { innovation } [ Innovation ].One of our great strengths as a nation is the breadth and depth of our { academic } [ Academy ] and { scientific } [ Science ] communities, backed up by some of the world's best { universities } [ University ].And we have a proud history of leading and supporting cutting-edge { research } [ Research ] and { innovation } [ Innovation ] {. } [ Innovation ]So we will also welcome agreement to continue to collaborate with our { European } [ Europe ] partners on major { science } [ Science ], { research } [ Research ], and { technology } [ Technology ] initiatives.From { space exploration } [ Space exploration ] to { clean energy } [ Sustainable energy ] to medical technologies, { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] will remain at the forefront of collective endeavours to better understand, and make better, the world in which we live.And a global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] will continue to cooperate with its { European } [ Europe ] partners in important areas such as { crime } [ Crime ], { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] and foreign affairs.All of us in { Europe } [ Europe ] face the challenge of cross-border crime, a deadly { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] threat, and the dangers presented by hostile { states } [ State (polity) ].With the threats to our common { security } [ Security ] becoming more serious, our response cannot be to cooperate with one another less, but to work together more.I therefore want our future relationship with the { European Union } [ European Union ] to include practical arrangements on matters of { law enforcement } [ Law enforcement ] and the sharing of { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] material with our { EU } [ European Union ] allies.I am proud of the role { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] has played and will continue to play in promoting { Europe } [ Europe ] {'s } [ Europe ] security.Britain has led { Europe } [ Europe ] on the measures needed to keep our continent secure - whether it is implementing sanctions against { Russia } [ Russia ] following its action in { Crimea } [ Crimea ], working for peace and stability in the { Balkans } [ Balkans ], or securing { Europe } [ Europe ]'s external border.We will continue to work closely with our { European } [ Europe ] allies in foreign and defence policy even as we leave the { EU } [ European Union ] itself.These are our objectives for the negotiation ahead - objectives that will help to realise our ambition of shaping that stronger, fairer, global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] that we want to see.They are the basis for a new, strong, constructive partnership with the { European Union } [ European Union ] - a partnership of friends and allies, of interests and values - a partnership for a strong { EU } [ European Union ] and a strong { UK } [ United Kingdom ].But there is one further objective we are setting.For as I have said before - it is in no-one's interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or a threat to stability, as we change from our existing relationship to a new partnership with the EU.By this, I do not mean that we will seek some form of unlimited transitional status, in which we find ourselves stuck forever in some kind of permanent political purgatory.Instead, I want us to have reached an agreement about our future partnership by the time the two-year Article 50 process has concluded.From that point onwards, we believe a phased process of implementation, in which both { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] institutions and { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ] prepare for the new arrangements that will exist between us will be in our mutual self-interest.This will give { businesses } [ Business ] enough time to { plan } [ Planning ] and prepare for those new arrangements.This might be about our { immigration } [ Immigration ] controls, { customs } [ Customs ] systems or the way in which we cooperate on { criminal justice } [ Criminal justice ] matters.Or it might be about the future { legal } [ Law ] and { regulatory } [ Regulation ] framework for { financial services } [ Financial services ] {. } [ Financial services ]For each issue, the { time } [ Time ] we need to phase-in the new arrangements may differ.Some might be introduced very quickly, some might take longer.And the interim arrangements we rely upon are likely to be a matter of negotiation.But the purpose is clear: we will seek to avoid a disruptive cliff-edge, and we will do everything we can to phase in the new arrangements we require as { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] move towards our new partnership.It is a comprehensive and carefully considered plan that focuses on the ends, not just the means - with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, and on the kind of country we will be once we leave.It reflects the hard work of many in this room today who have worked tirelessly to bring it together and to prepare this country for the negotiation ahead.And it will, I know, be debated and discussed at length.That is only right.But those who urge us to reveal more - such as the blow-by-blow details of our negotiating strategy, the areas in which we might compromise, the places where we think there are potential trade-offs - will not be acting in the national interest.Because this is not a game or a time for opposition for opposition's sake.It is a crucial and sensitive { negotiation } [ Negotiation ] that will define the interests and the success of our country for many years to come.That is why I have said before - and will continue to say - that every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].Our opposite numbers in the { European Commission } [ European Commission ] know it, which is why they are keeping their discipline.And the { ministers } [ Minister (government) ] in this { government } [ Government ] know it too, which is why we will also maintain ours.So however frustrating some people find it, the { government } [ Government ] will not be pressured into saying more than I believe it is in our national interest to say.Because it is not my job to fill column inches with daily updates, but to get the right deal for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].And that is what I intend to do.I am confident that a deal - and a new strategic partnership between the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] - can be achieved.This is firstly because, having held conversations with almost every leader from every single EU member state, having spent time talking to the senior figures from the European institutions, including President { Tusk } [usk ], President { Juncker } [ Jean-Paul Juncker ], and President { Schulz } [ Martin Schulz ]; and after my Cabinet colleagues { David Davis } [ David Davis (British politician) ], { Philip Hammond } [ Philip Hammond ] and { Boris Johnson } [ Boris Johnson ] have done the same with their interlocutors, I am confident that the vast majority want a positive relationship between the UK and the EU after { Brexit } [ Brexit ].And I am confident that the objectives I am setting out today are consistent with the needs of the { EU } [ European Union ] and its member states.That is why our objectives include a proposed free trade agreement between { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { European Union } [ European Union ], and explicitly rule out membership of the EU's { single market } [ European Single Market ].Because when the { EU } [ European Union ]'s leaders say they believe the four freedoms of the { single market } [ European Single Market ] are indivisible, we respect that position.When the 27 { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ] say they want to continue their journey inside the { European Union } [ European Union ] {, } [ European Union ] we not only respect that fact but support it.Because we do not want to undermine the { single market } [ Single market ], and we do not want to undermine the { European Union } [ European Union ].We want the { EU } [ European Union ] to be a success and we want its remaining { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ] to prosper.And of course we want the same for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].And the second reason I believe it is possible to reach a good deal is that the kind of agreement I have described today is the economically rational thing that both { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] should aim for.Because { trade } [ Trade ] is not a { zero sum } [ Zero-sum game ] game: more of it makes us all more prosperous.Free trade between { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { European Union } [ European Union ] means more trade, and more trade means more jobs and more wealth creation.The erection of new { barriers } [ Trade barrier ] to { trade } [ Trade ], meanwhile, means the reverse: less { trade } [ Trade ], fewer jobs, lower { growth } [ Economic growth ].The third and final reason I believe we can come to the right agreement is that cooperation between { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] is needed not just when it comes to trade but when it comes to our security too.Britain and { France } [ France ] are { Europe } [ Europe ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] only two nuclear powers.We are the only two { European } [ Europe ] countries with permanent seats on the { United Nations } [ United Nations ] { Security Council } [ United Nations Security Council ].Britain's armed forces are a crucial part of { Europe } [ Europe ] {'s } [ Europe ] collective defence.And our { intelligence } [ Intelligence assessment ] capabilities - unique in { Europe } [ Europe ] - have already saved countless lives in very many { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] plots that have been thwarted in countries across our continent.After { Brexit } [ Brexit ], { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] wants to be a good friend and neighbour in every way, and that includes defending the safety and security of all of our citizens.So I believe the framework I have outlined today is in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s interests.It is in { Europe } [ Europe ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] interests.And it is in the interests of the wider world.But I must be clear.Britain wants to remain a good friend and neighbour to { Europe } [ Europe ].Yet I know there are some voices calling for a punitive deal that punishes { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and discourages other countries from taking the same path.That would be an act of calamitous { self-harm } [ Self-harm ] for the countries of { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ Self-harm ]And it would not be the act of a friend.Britain would not - indeed we could not - accept such an approach.We would be free to strike trade deals across the world.And we would have the freedom to set the competitive { tax } [ Tax ] rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world's best { companies } [ Company ] and biggest { investors } [ Investor ] to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].And - if we were excluded from accessing the { single market } [ Single market ] - we would be free to change the basis of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { economic model } [ Economic model ].But for the { EU } [ European Union ] {, } [ European Union ] it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world.It would jeopardise investments in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] by { EU } [ European Union ] companies worth more than { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]0.5 trillion.It would mean a loss of access for { European } [ Europe ] firms to the { financial services } [ Financial services ] of the { City of London } [ City of London ] {. } [ City of London ]It would risk exports from the { EU } [ European Union ] to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] worth around \u00a3290bn every year.And it would disrupt the sophisticated and integrated { supply chains } [ Supply chain ] upon which many { EU } [ European Union ] companies rely.Important sectors of the { EU } [ European Union ] economy would also suffer.We are a crucial - profitable - export market for { Europe } [ Europe ]'s automotive industry, as well as sectors including { energy } [ Energy ], food and drink, { chemicals } [ Chemical substance ], { pharmaceuticals } [ Medication ], and { agriculture } [ Agriculture ].And I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell { German } [ Germany ] exporters, { French } [ France ] farmers, { Spanish } [ Spain ] fishermen, the young unemployed of the { Eurozone } [ Eurozone ], and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and make a political point.For all these reasons - and because of our shared values and the spirit of goodwill that exists on both sides - I am confident that we will follow a better path. I am confident that a positive agreement can be reached.It is right that the { government } [ Government ] should prepare for every eventuality - but to do so in the knowledge that a constructive and optimistic approach to the negotiations to come is in the best interests of { Europe } [ Europe ] and the best interests of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].We do not approach these { negotiations } [ Negotiation ] expecting { failure } [ Failure ], but anticipating { success } [ Success ].Because we are a great, global nation with so much to offer { Europe } [ Europe ] and so much to offer the world - one of the world's largest and strongest economies, with the finest intelligence services, the bravest armed forces, the most effective hard and soft power, and friendships, partnerships and alliances in every continent, and another thing that's important, the essential ingredient of our success - the strength and support of 65 million people willing us to make it happen, because after all the division and discord, the country is coming together.The { referendum } [ Referendum ] was divisive at times.And those divisions have taken time to heal.But one of the reasons that { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { democracy } [ Democracy ] has been such a success for so many years is that the strength of our identity as one { nation } [ Nation ], the respect we show to one another as fellow citizens, and the importance we attach to our institutions means that when a vote has been held we all respect the result.The victors have the responsibility to act magnanimously.The losers have the responsibility to respect the legitimacy of the outcome.And the { country } [ Country ] comes together.And that is what we are seeing today.Business isn't calling to reverse the result, but planning to make a success of it.The { House of Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ] has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it.And the overwhelming majority of { people } [ People ] - however they voted - want us to get on with it too.So that is what we will do.Not merely forming a new partnership with { Europe } [ Europe ], but building a stronger, fairer, more global { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] too.And let that be the legacy of our { time } [ Time ], the prize towards which we work, the destination at which we arrive once the { negotiation } [ Negotiation ] is done.And let us do it not for ourselves, but for those who follow, for the country's children and grandchildren too.So that when future generations look back at this time, they will judge us not only by the decision that we made, but by what we made of that decision.They will see that we shaped them a brighter future.They will know that we built them a better { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170204022803/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30250299": "Just as this { government } [ Government ] has a long term plan for where we are taking our country so within that we have a long-term plan for { immigration } [ Immigration ].It needs to be fair.And it needs to be centred around our national interest.That is what I want.And let me tell you why I care so passionately about getting this right - and getting the whole debate on immigration right in our country.When I think about what makes me proud to be { British } [ United Kingdom ] yes, it is our { history } [ History ], our { values } [ Value (ethics) ], our { creativity } [ Creativity ], our { compassion } [ Compassion ] but there is something else too.I am extremely proud that together we have built a successful, multi-racial democracy.A { country } [ Country ] where in one or two { generations } [ Generation ] people can come with nothing and rise as high as their { talent } [ Aptitude ] allows.A { country } [ Country ] whose success has been founded not on building separate futures, but rather coming together to build a common home.We have always been an open nation, welcoming those who want to make a contribution and build a decent life for themselves and their families.From the { Jewish } [ Jews ] communities who came to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] before { World War One } [ World War I ] to the { West Indians } [ British West Indies ] who docked at { Tilbury } [ Tilbury ] on the Windrush and helped to rebuild our country after { World War Two } [ World War II ].Even at times of war and danger, when our island status has protected us, we have offered sanctuary to those fleeing tyranny and persecution.We will never forget the { Polish } [ Poland ] and { Czech } [ Czech Republic ] pilots who helped save this country in its hour of need and the { Poles } [ Poland ] who went on to settle here, help build post war { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and indeed contribute so much to our country today.And we are proud of the role we played in providing a haven to the { Ugandan } [ Uganda ] { Asians } [ Asian people ] in the early 1970s who now count among their number four Members of the { House of Lords } [ House of Lords ], some of the UK's most successful businessmen, a { BBC News } [ BBC News ] presenter and the owner of a company providing china to the royal households.Our openness is part of who we are.We should celebrate it. We should never allow anyone to demonise it.And we must never give in to those who would throw away our values, with the appalling prospect of repatriating migrants who are here totally legally and have lived here for years.So it is fundamental to the future of our country that we get this issue right.And in doing so, there are three dangerous views which we need to confront.First, is the complacent view that says the levels of { immigration } [ Immigration ] we've seen in the past decade aren't really a problem at all.That mass { migration } [ Human migration ] is an unavoidable by-product of a new world order of { globalisation } [ Globalization ].That { globalisation } [ Globalization ] is an unalloyed good - and those complaining about { immigration } [ Immigration ] just need to get with the modern world.Often the people who have these views are those who have no direct experience of the impact of high levels of migration.They have never waited on a { social housing } [ Public housing ] list or found that their child's { classroom } [ Classroom ] is overcrowded or felt that their { community } [ Community ] has changed too fast.And what makes everyone else really angry is that if they dare to express these concerns they can be made to feel guilty about doing so.We should be clear.It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country.People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: { control } [ Control (management) ] {. } [ Control (management) ]People want { Government } [ Government ] to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come, both from around the world and from within the { European Union } [ European Union ].They want control over who has the right to receive benefits and what is expected of them in return.They want to know that foreign criminals can be excluded - or if already here, removed.And they want us to manage carefully the pressures on our { schools } [ School ] {, } [ University of Toronto ] our { hospitals } [ Hospital ] and our { housing } [ House ].If we are to maintain this successful open meritocratic { democracy } [ Democracy ] we treasure, we have to maintain faith in { government } [ Government ] {'s } [ Government of India ] ability to control the rate at which people come to this { country } [ Country ].And yet in recent years, it has become clear that successive { Governments } [ Government ] have lacked control.People want grip. I get that. And I completely agree.To respond to this with complacency is both wrong and dangerous.The second dangerous view is to think we can somehow pull up the drawbridge and retreat from the world, shutting off immigration altogether.People who make this argument try to dress it up as speaking up for our country.But this { isolationism } [ Isolationism ] is actually deeply { unpatriotic } [ Patriarchy ] {. } [ Patriotism ]Yes, { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] is an { island } [ Island ] nation.But we have never been an insular one.We have used the seas that surround our shores not to cut ourselves off from the world, but to reach out to it - to carry our trade to the four corners of the earth.And with that trade has come { people } [ People ], { companies } [ Company ], { jobs } [ Job ] and { investment } [ Investment ].We have always understood that our national greatness is built on our openness.We see that every day.In our { National Health Service } [ National Health Service ] {, } [ National Health Service ] which would grind to a halt without the hundreds of thousands who have come from overseas to help run it.In the { City of London } [ City of London ], the financial epicentre of the world, where so many, from so many different countries, have come to make { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] their home.In our world class { universities } [ University ], where { students } [ Student ] and indeed { professors } [ Professor ] have come from all over the world.This is modern { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]A { country } [ Country ] that has come out of { recession } [ Recession ] to become the fastest growing advanced { economy } [ Economy ] in the { world } [ World ].That has happened in part because we are an open nation.And for the sake of { British } [ United Kingdom ] jobs, { British } [ United Kingdom ] livelihoods and { British } [ United Kingdom ] opportunities we must fight this dangerous and misguided view that our nation can withdraw from the world and somehow all will be well.The third view we need to confront is the idea that a successful plan to control { immigration } [ Immigration ] is only about { immigration } [ Immigration ] policy and controls.A modern { immigration } [ Immigration ] plan is not just about the decisions you take on the people you allow into your country.It is also about the { education } [ Education ] you provide to your own people and the { rights } [ Rights ] and { responsibilities } [ Moral responsibility ] at the heart of your { welfare } [ Welfare ] system.Because the problem hasn't just been a simplistic one of too many people coming here it's also been too many { British } [ United Kingdom ] people untrained and too many { British } [ United Kingdom ] people without the incentive to work because they can get a better income living on benefits.Even at the end of the so-called boom years, there were around five-million people in our country of working age but on out-of-work benefits.And this was at the same time as the last government enabled the largest wave of migration in our country's history.I want young { British } [ United Kingdom ] people schooled enough, skilled enough, keen enough to work so there is less demand for foreign workers.Put simply, our job is to educate and train up our youth, so we are less reliant on immigration to fill our skills gaps.And any { politician } [ Politician ] who doesn't have a serious plan for { welfare } [ Welfare ] and { education } [ Education ], has no sensible long-term plan for controlling { immigration } [ Immigration ].In taking on these three views we also need to choose our language carefully.We must anchor the debate in fact not prejudice.We must have no truck with those who use { immigration } [ Immigration ] to foment division, or as a surrogate for other agendas.We should distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions.There are no simple solutions.Managing { immigration } [ Immigration ] is hard.Not only here.But in every major { developed } [ Developed country ] economy.Look at { Italy } [ Italy ], where { migration } [ Human migration ] from { North Africa } [ North Africa ] is a vital issue.Look at { Germany } [ Germany ] {, } [ Berlin ] where benefit tourism is a huge concern.Or look at the { United States } [ United States ], the ultimate melting pot, where { President } [ President of the United States ] { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] has just announced sweeping reforms.Look at { Australia } [ Australia ], whose points-based system we now operate in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ], where the issue of immigration dominated their last election campaign and where migrant numbers are actually higher, pro rata, than in the UK.The { British } [ United Kingdom ] people understand this.They know that a modern, { knowledge-based } [ Knowledge economy ] economy like { ours } [ Economy of the United Kingdom ] needs { immigration } [ Immigration ].There is a parallel here.On the { EU } [ European Union ], most { British } [ United Kingdom ] people don't want a false choice between the { status quo } [ Status quo ] or { leaving } [ Withdrawal from the European Union ].They want controlled { immigration } [ Immigration ] {. } [ Border control ]And they are right.So what are the facts?Over the last ten years, { immigration } [ Immigration ] to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] has soared, while the number of { Britons } [ United Kingdom ] going to work abroad has remained roughly the same.As a result, net { immigration } [ Immigration ] - a reasonably good way of measuring the pressure of { immigration } [ Immigration ] - has gone up significantly.In terms of the net figures.In the thirty years leading up to 2004, net migration in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] was around one million.In just the next seven years, it was 1.5 million.The { gross } [ Gross (unit) ] figures are that 8.3 million people came to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] as long-term migrants in the thirty years leading up to 2004.And a further 4 million came in the next seven years.What caused this increase?Certainly, a lax approach to { immigration } [ Immigration ] by the last { Government } [ Government ] {, } [ Department of the Interior (United Kingdom) ] which they themselves have since admitted.It was too easy for foreign nationals to become { citizens } [ Citizenship ].There was a huge increase in { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] claims.There were disproportionate numbers of jobs going to { foreign workers } [ Foreign worker ] {. } [ Foreign worker ]The welfare system allowed new EU { migrant workers } [ Migrant worker ] to claim immediately, without having paid in, which is in contrast to many other countries.And, of course, there was the decision by the last Government not to impose transitional controls on the eight new countries which entered the EU in 2004.With their economies considerably poorer than ours - and with almost every other { EU } [ European Union ] country opting to keep controls - it made the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] a uniquely attractive destination for the citizens of those countries.One million people came to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] after that decision.When we came to office in 2010, we were determined to get to grips with this problem.So we set a clear target: to return net migration to 1990s levels when even though we had an open economy, proper immigration controls meant immigration was in the tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands.And we set to work on it immediately, with a clear plan to tackle non-EU migration in a targeted way while continuing to permit companies to bring in the skilled workers they needed and allowing universities to attract the best talent from around the world.So we took action to cut numbers and tackle abuse on every { visa } [ Travel visa ] route for those coming to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] from outside { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]We imposed an annual cap on economic migration of 20,700.We clamped down on bogus students and stopped nearly 800 fake colleges bringing people in.We insisted that those wishing to have family come and join them must earn at least { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]18,600 per year and pass an { English } [ English language ] language test.In addition, we have made { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] a much harder place to exist as an { illegal } [ Illegal immigration ] { immigrant } [ Immigration ] {. } [ Immigration ]This is all relentless, painstaking work.I have been out on the ground with { Border Force } [ Border Force ] staff.I have talked with the { immigration } [ Immigration ] officers who used to have no choice but to admit what they felt sure were fake students, claiming to come here to study without being able to speak a word of { English } [ English language ].We have tightened up across the board: not only at the border, but inside the country too by stopping illegal immigrants from opening a { bank account } [ Bank account ], obtaining a { driving licence } [ Driver's license ], and renting a { home } [ Home ].These are measures that other parties did not support but which I believe are essential and need to be carried forward further.We have also brought back vital exit checks at { ports } [ Port ] and { airports } [ Airport ].And by April, those checks will be in force at all our major { ports } [ Port ] and { airports } [ Airport ].So we will be able not only to count people in, but to count them out again.And in { Calais } [ Calais ] we have created a \u00a312 million fund to strengthen security, and we are working more closely than ever with our { French } [ France ] partners to tackle illegal immigration and track down people smugglers.This determined effort is making a real difference.Even after yesterday's disappointing figures, net migration from outside { Europe } [ Europe ] is down by almost a quarter, and falling close to the levels seen in the late 1990s.Without our reforms, in the last year alone, 50,000 more migrants from outside the { EU } [ European Union ] would have come to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ].But if I am { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Sweden ] after the { election } [ Elections in Sweden ] {, } [ Elections in Sweden ] we will go further {. } [ Elections in Sweden ]We will revoke licences from { colleges } [ College ] and { businesses } [ Business ] which fail to do enough to prevent large numbers of { migrants } [ Immigration ] they sponsor from overstaying their { visas } [ Travel visa ].We will extend our new policy of 'deport first, appeal later' to cover all immigration appeals where a so-called right to family life is invoked.We will rapidly implement the requirement, included in our 2014 Immigration Act, for landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants.We will do all of these things.And we will continue with our welfare and education reforms making sure that it always pays to work training more { British } [ United Kingdom ] workers right across the country, but especially in local areas that are heavily reliant on migrant labour and supporting those communities with a new fund to help meet the additional demands on local services.We will also introduce stronger powers to tackle criminal gangs who bring people into this country and then withhold their passports and their pay.And I am proud that today we are publishing our Modern Slavery Strategy, clamping down on those appalling criminals who try and traffic people here.But our action to cut migration from outside the EU has not been enough to meet our target of cutting the overall numbers to the tens of thousands.The figures yesterday demonstrate that again.As we have reduced the numbers coming to the UK from outside the { EU } [ European Union ], the numbers from inside the { EU } [ European Union ] have risen.In other words, our squeeze in one area has been offset by a bulge in another.The ambition remains the right one. But it's clear: it's going to take more { time } [ Time (magazine) ], more { work } [ Work (magazine) ] and more difficult long term decisions to get there.Some people disagree with the whole concept of a net migration target, because they say you can be blown off course by the numbers emigrating each year.But there are two reasons why I think it's worthwhile.It measures the overall impact of { migration } [ Human migration ] in our country.And { emigration } [ Emigration ] figures from { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] are relatively constant.But I accept the { logic } [ Logic ] of the { argument } [ Argument ] about { emigration } [ Emigration ] {. } [ Emigration ]So as well as sticking to our ambition, we will set out additional metrics in the future so that people can clearly chart progress on the scale of migration from outside the EU - and from within it.So let me set out why net migration from the { EU } [ European Union ] is rising and what we are going to do about it.The first thing to say is that it is a tribute to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] that so many people want to come here.That has not always been the case.In the 1970s, when { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] was the sick man of { Europe } [ Europe ], more people were leaving { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] than coming here.Today, they are coming for perfectly understandable reasons.We are currently the jobs factory for { Europe } [ Europe ].Our { unemployment } [ Unemployment ] is tumbling, and is now about half the level of { France } [ France ] and a quarter the level of { Spain } [ Spain ] {. } [ Spain ]And whereas in the past the majority of the growth in employment was taken up by foreign nationals last year two thirds of that growth benefited { British } [ United Kingdom ] workers.While some { Eurozone } [ Eurozone ] economies remain weak, our economy is now growing faster than every major economy in { Europe } [ Europe ] and is the fastest growing economy in the { G7 } [ Group of Seven ].That fact - combined with our generous welfare system, including for those in work - makes the UK a magnetic destination for workers from other { European } [ Europe ] countries.And let me be clear: the great majority of those who come here from { Europe } [ Europe ] come to work, work hard and pay their taxes.They contribute to our country.They are willing to travel across the { continent } [ Continent ] in search of a better life for them and their { families } [ Family ].Many of them come just for a short period - a year or two - before returning home.And once { economic growth } [ Economic growth ] returns to the countries of the { Eurozone } [ Eurozone ], and those economies start to grow and prosper, the { economic pendulum } [ Economic pendulum ] will start to swing back.That will require far-reaching structural reform and removing barriers to job creation.And I welcome the intention of the new { Commission } [ European Commission ] to tackle these issues: they will have the whole-hearted support of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] in doing so.So what, my { European } [ Europe ] counterparts say to me, is the issue?They say: you have { unemployment } [ Unemployment ] falling and your { economy } [ Economy ] growing: this does not look to us like a serious problem.Indeed, many say they 'wish we had the sort of problems you have'.And some in { Europe } [ Europe ] just think our problems are because our { welfare } [ Welfare ] system is a soft touch.But this { Government } [ Government of Australia ] has already taken unprecedented action to make our welfare system fairer and less open to abuse, all within the current rules.And these reforms, including restricting EU jobseeker entitlements, will save our taxpayers half a billion pounds over the next five years.But even with these changes, the { pressure } [ Pressure ] is still very great.In some areas, the number of migrants we are seeing is far higher than our { local authorities } [ Local government ], our { schools } [ School ] and our { hospitals } [ Hospital ] can cope with.They are much higher than anything the { EU } [ European Union ] has known before in its { history } [ History of the European Union ] {. } [ History of the European Union ]And they are far higher than what the founding fathers envisaged when the { European Economic Community } [ European Economic Community ] was established in 1957 or what { Margaret Thatcher } [ Margaret Thatcher ] and { Helmut Kohl } [ Helmut Kohl ] envisaged when they signed the { Single European Act } [ Single European Act ] in 1986.One million people coming to one Member State is a vast { migration } [ Human migration ], on a scale that has not happened before in peacetime.And yesterday's figures show that the scale of { migration } [ Human migration ] is still very great.There are { secondary } [ Secondary school ] schools where the turnover of pupils can be as high as one third of the entire { school } [ School ] in a year.There are { primary } [ Primary school ] schools where dozens of { languages } [ Language ] are spoken with only a small minority speaking { English } [ English language ] as their { first language } [ First language ].There are { hospitals } [ Hospital ] where { maternity } [ Mother ] units are under great pressure because { birth } [ Birth ] rates have increased dramatically.There are { Accident } [ Emergency department ] and { Emergency } [ Emergency department ] departments under serious pressure.And there is pressure on { social housing } [ Public housing ] that cannot be met.And in a country with a generous, non-contributory { welfare } [ Welfare ] system, all this is raising real issues of fairness.People cannot understand how those who have not paid in can immediately take out.And they find it incomprehensible that a family coming from another { EU } [ European Union ] country can claim child benefit from the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] - at { UK } [ United Kingdom ] rates - and send it back to children still living in their home country.When trust in the { EU } [ European Union ] is already so low, we cannot afford to leave injustices like this to fester.Some of our partners will say: 'But you are not unique'.Germany, for instance, has had more EU migrants than the UK.But { Germany } [ Germany ] is in a different situation.Germany's population is falling, and { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] is rising.Now dealing with this issue in the { EU } [ European Union ] is not straightforward, because of the freedom of movement to which all { EU } [ European Union ] Member States sign up.I want to be clear: { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] supports the principle of the free movement of workers.We benefit from it, and 1.3 million { British } [ United Kingdom ] citizens exercise their right to go and live and work, and in many cases retire, in other { European } [ Europe ] countries.Accepting the principle of free movement of workers is a key to being part of the { single market } [ Single market ].A { market } [ Market (economics) ] from which { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] has benefited enormously.So we do not want to destroy that principle or turn it on its head.Those who argue that { Norway } [ Norway ] or { Switzerland } [ Switzerland ] offer a better model for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] ignore one crucial fact: they have each had to sign up to the principle of freedom of movement in order to access the single market and both countries actually have far higher per capita immigration than the UK.But { freedom of movement } [ Freedom of movement ] has never been an unqualified right, and we now need to allow it to operate on a more sustainable basis in the light of the experience of recent years.That does not mean a closed door regime or a fundamental assault on the principle of free movement.What it does mean is finding arrangements to allow a { Member State } [ Member state ] like the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] to restore a sense of fairness and bring down the current spike in numbers.My objective is simple: to make our immigration system fairer and reduce the current exceptionally high level of migration from within the EU into the UK.I am completely committed to delivering that - and I am ready to discuss with our partners any methods which achieve it, while maintaining the overall principle to which they, and we, attach importance.So let me set out the action we intend to take to cut migration from within { Europe } [ Europe ] by dealing with abuse restricting the ability of migrants to stay here without a job and reducing the incentives for lower paid, lower skilled workers to come here in the first place.First, we want to create the toughest system in the { EU } [ European Union ] for dealing with abuse of free movement.This includes stronger powers to { deport } [ Deportation ] { criminals } [ Crime ] and stop them coming back.And tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement including beggars, rough sleepers, fraudsters and people who collude in sham marriages.We must also deal with the extraordinary situation where it's easier for an { EU } [ European Union ] citizen to bring anon-EU spouse to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ], than it is for a { British } [ United Kingdom ] citizen to do the same.At the moment, if a { British } [ United Kingdom ] citizen wants to bring, say, a { South American } [ South America ] partner to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], then we ask for proof that they meet an income threshold and can speak { English } [ English language ].But { EU law } [ European Union law ] means we cannot apply these tests to { EU } [ European Union ] migrants. Their partners can just come straight into our country without any proper controls at all.We have got to end this abuse.Second, we want { EU } [ European Union ] jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here and to stop { UK } [ United Kingdom ] taxpayers having to support them if they don't.This government inherited an indefensible system where the State - our taxpayers - paid EU jobseekers to look for work indefinitely and even paid their rent while they did so.In total that meant the { British } [ United Kingdom ] { taxpayer } [ Taxpayer ] was supporting a typical { EU } [ European Union ] jobseeker with { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]600 a month.We have already begun to change this.We've scrapped housing benefit for EU jobseekers.And we have limited benefits claims to three months for those { EU } [ European Union ] migrants who have no prospect of a job.But now we are going to go further.We are overhauling our { welfare } [ Welfare ] system with a new benefit called { Universal Credit } [ Universal Credit ].This will replace existing { benefits } [ Welfare ] such as { Jobseekers' Allowance } [ Jobseekers' Allowance ] that support people out of work.And its legal status means we can regain control over who we pay it to.So as { Universal Credit } [ Universal Credit ] is introduced we will pass a new law that means EU jobseekers will not be able to claim it.And we will do this within existing { EU law } [ European Union law ] {. } [ European Union law ] So instead of { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]600, they will get nothing.We also want to restrict the time that jobseekers can legally stay in this country.So if an EU jobseeker has not found work within six months, they will be required to leave.Let's be clear what this will mean.At the moment 40 per cent of those coming to work in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] do not have a job offer when they arrive - the highest proportion in the { EU } [ European Union ].Many of these will no longer come.EU jobseekers who don't pay in will no longer get anything out.And those who do come will no longer be able to stay if they can't find work.There was a time when { freedom of movement } [ Freedom of movement ] meant Member States could expect workers to have a job offer before they arrived and this will return us closer to that position.Third, we want to reduce the number of { EU } [ European Union ] workers coming to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ].Of course, that means never repeating the mistake that was made in 2004.So we will insist that when new countries are admitted to the EU in the future, free movement will not apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing Member States.Future accession { treaties } [ Treaty ] require unanimous agreement of all { Member States } [ Member state ] {. } [ Member state ]So the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] will ensure this change is included.And that means reducing the incentives for lower paid, low skilled EU workers to come here in the first place.Our { welfare } [ Welfare ] system is unusual in { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ Welfare ] It pays out before you pay into it.That gives us particular difficulties, especially in respect of { benefits } [ Employee benefits ] while you are working - so called 'in work { benefits } [ Employee benefits ]'.Someone coming to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] from elsewhere in the EU, who is employed on the { minimum wage } [ Minimum wage ] and who has two children back in their home country, will receive around \u00a3700 per month in benefits in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ].This is more than twice what they would receive in { Germany } [ Germany ]. And three times more than in { France } [ France ] {. } [ Economy of France ]No wonder so many people want to come to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]These { tax credits } [ Tax credit ] and other { welfare } [ Welfare ] payments are a big financial incentive, and we know that over 400,000 { EU } [ European Union ] migrants take advantage of them.This has got to change.So I will insist that in the future those who want to claim { tax credits } [ Tax credit ] and { child benefit } [ Child benefit ] must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years.If their child is living abroad, then there should be no { child benefit } [ Child benefit ] or child tax credit at all no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid.And we will introduce a new residency requirement for { social housing } [ Public housing ] - meaning that you can't even be considered for a { council house } [ Council house ] unless you have been here for at least four years.This is about saying: our welfare system is like a national club.It's made up of the contribution of hardworking { British } [ United Kingdom ] taxpayers.Millions of people doing the right thing, paying into the system, generation after generation.It cannot be right that { migrants } [ Immigration ] can turn up and claim full rights to this { club } [ Football team ] straightaway.So let's be clear what all of these changes taken together will mean.EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here.UK { taxpayers } [ Tax ] will not support them if they don't.And once they are in work {, } [ Liverpool ] they won't get benefits or { social housing } [ Public housing ] from { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] unless they have been here for at least four years.Yes, these are radical reformsBut they are also reasonable and fair.And the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people need to know that changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation.And that is what I am determined to deliver.They take account of the particular circumstances of our own welfare system, and they go with the grain of what other { Member States } [ Member state of the European Union ] with high numbers of EU benefit claimants are considering.But if negotiating for the whole { EU } [ European Union ] should not prove possible, I would want to see them included in a UK-only settlement.Now I know many will say this is impossible - just impossible.Some of the most ardent supporters of the { European Union } [ European Union ] will say it is impossible - fearing that if an accommodation is made for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ], the whole { European Union } [ European Union ] will unravel.And those who passionately want { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to leave the { European Union } [ European Union ] will say it is impossible - and that the only way to control migration into the UK is to leave the EU.On this, at least, they will agree.To those who claim change is impossible, I respond with one word, the most powerful word in the { English } [ English language ] language.Why?Why is it impossible?Why is it impossible to find a way forward on this issue, and on other issues, that meet the real concerns of a major { Member State } [ Member state of the European Union ], one of the biggest net contributors to the EU budget?I simply don't accept such defeatism.I say to our { European } [ Europe ] partners.We have real concerns.Our concerns are not outlandish or unreasonable.We deserve to be heard, and we must be heard.Not only for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] sake, but for the sake of { Europe } [ Europe ] as a whole.Because what is happening in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] is not unique to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ].Across the { European Union } [ European Union ], issues of { migration } [ Human migration ] are causing real concern and raising real questions.Can movements on the scale we have seen in recent years always be in the best interests of the EU and wider { European } [ Europe ] solidarity?Can it be in the interests of central and eastern { European } [ Europe ] Member States that so many of their brightest and best are drawn away from home when they are needed most?This concern takes a different form in different Member States, and has different causes.But it has one common feature: it is contributing to a corrosion of trust in the { European Union } [ European Union ] and the rise of { populist } [ Populism ] parties.If we ignore it, it will not go away.Across the { European Union } [ European Union ] we are seeing the frustrations of our citizens, demonstrated in the results of the { European Elections } [ Elections to the European Parliament ].Leadership means dealing with those frustrations, not turning a deaf ear to them.And we have a duty to act on them, to restore the democratic legitimacy of the EU.It's time we talked about this properly.And a { conversation } [ Conversation ] cannot begin with the word \" {no } [ No ] {\". } [ No ]The entire { European Union } [ European Union ] is built on a gift for { compromise } [ Compromise ], for finding ways round difficult corners, for accepting that sometimes we have to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good.That is the way the { EU } [ European Union ] operates. That is the way a Union of 28 { democracies } [ Democracy ] has to operate.Flexibility not rigidity.Creativity not dogma.Only this month a way was found to accommodate { France } [ France ] breaching its budget deficit limit, as everyone knew it would be.And it can be done again.I stand by every word of that speech today.A reformed { EU } [ European Union ], in the interests not only of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ], but of every { Member State } [ Member state of the European Union ] {. } [ European Union ]Of course I know the arguments that will be put.It will be argued that { freedom of movement } [ Freedom of movement ] is a holy principle - one of the four cardinal principles of the EU, alongside freedom of capital {, } [ European Union freedom of movement ] of services { and } [ European Union freedom of movement ] of goods - and that what we are suggesting is { heresy } [ Heresy ].To which I say: hang on a moment.No one claims that the other three freedoms have yet been fully implemented.Far from it.It is still not possible for a { British } [ United Kingdom ] optician to trade freely in { Italy } [ Italy ], or a { French } [ France ] company to raise funds in { Germany } [ Germany ].It is still not possible for consumers to access their { Netflix } [ Netflix ] or { iTunes } [ ITunes ] accounts across borders in the { EU } [ European Union ].And { freedom of movement } [ Freedom of movement ] itself is not absolute.There are rules for when new { Member States } [ Member state of the European Union ] join the EU precisely to cope with excessive numbers.So why can't there be steps to allow Member States a greater degree of control, in order to uphold a general and important principle, but one which is already qualified?And of course { freedom of movement } [ Freedom of movement ] has evolved significantly over the years from applying to job-holders to job-seekers too from job-seekers to their non- {European } [ Europe ] family members and from a right to work, to a right to claim a range of benefits.So I am saying to our { European } [ Europe ] partners.I ask you to work with us on this.I know some of you will be saying: why bother?Some of you may even say that in public.To which my answer is clear: because it is worth it.Look at what { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] brings to { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]The fastest growing economy and the second largest.One of { Europe } [ Europe ] {'s } [ Netherlands ] strongest powers.Here is an issue which matters to the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people, and to our future in the { European Union } [ European Union ].The { British } [ United Kingdom ] people will not understand - frankly I will not understand - if a sensible way through cannot be found, which will help settle this country's place in the EU once and for all.And to the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people I say this.I share your concern, and I am acting on it.I know how much this matters.I promised we would cut the { EU } [ European Union ] budget - and we have.I said I would veto a { Treaty } [ Treaty ] that was not in our interests, and I did.I do not pretend this will be easy.It won't.It will require a lot of hard pounding, a lot of hard { negotiation } [ Negotiation ].But it will be worth it.Because those who promise you simple solutions are betraying you.Those who say we would certainly be better off outside the EU only ever tell you part of the story.Of course we would survive, there is no doubt about that.And we would of course lose the automatic right for the 1.3 million { British } [ United Kingdom ] citizens who today are living and working elsewhere in { Europe } [ Europe ] to do so.That is something we would want to think carefully about giving up.For me, I have one test, and one test only: what is in the best, long term interests of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]?That is the measure against which everything must be judged.If you elect me as { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] in { May } [ May 2016 United Kingdom general election ], I will negotiate to reform the { European Union } [ European Union ], and { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s relationship with it.This issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation.If I succeed, I will, as I have said, campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU.If our concerns fall on deaf ears and we cannot put our relationship with the { EU } [ European Union ] on a better footing, then of course I rule nothing out.But I am confident that, with goodwill and understanding, we can and will succeed.At the end of the day, whatever happens, the final decision will be yours, when you place your cross on the ballot paper in the { referendum } [ Referendum ] to decide whether { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] remains in the { European Union } [ European Union ].That decision is for you, the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people, and for you alone."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20160501200033/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-northern-ireland-35799467": "They represent a cross-section of 18 to 25-year-olds living in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] and will take part in discussions in the { BBC } [ BBC ] {'s } [ BBC ] coverage of the election.These young people are from a diverse range of backgrounds and communities.Here you'll find the whole group, introducing themselves to the nation in their own words.Join the conversation with @BBCGen2016 and find out more at bbc.co.uk/generation2016.I am studying for A levels in { politics } [ Politics ], { English } [ England ] { literature } [ Literature ] and { history } [ History ]. My love for { rock } [ Rock music ], { indie } [ Independent music ] and { metal } [ Heavy metal music ] music is close to complete religious devotion, so a lot of my time is spent either listening to my favourite bands at home or going to { concerts } [ Concert ] and { gigs } [ Concert ]. I also love watching { Friends } [ Friends ], { independent films } [ Independent film ] and { reading } [ Reading ]. Despite crashing into a car in a { car park } [ Parking lot ] six days after passing my test, one of my other favourite things is going on drives with my friends. I would describe myself as very talkative, and this comes in handy with my interest in { politics } [ Politics ] and my plan to read { law } [ Law ] with { politics } [ Politics ] at { university } [ University ]. I'm a great believer in living in an open society, and here in NI we need to have more conversations on \"awkward\" topics like { the Troubles } [ The Troubles ], as well as breaking down { social norms } [ Social norm ].  My main hopes for the foreseeable future are { LGBT } [ LGBT ] equality in NI, a greater representation of women in politics and less disparity between the \"rich\" and the \"poor\".I am a student at { Ulster University } [ Ulster University ] {, } [ Ulster University ] { Jordanstown } [ Jordanstown ] {. } [ Ulster University ] I was born, raised and still live in the small town of { Kells } [ Kells, County Antrim ], { County Antrim } [ County Antrim ], though this summer may see some big changes as I hopefully move to the big city! I would say I'm fun and easy going, always up for a good ol' laugh and adventures are always welcome.\u202fI am a first year undergraduate of { BSc } [ Bachelor of Science ] communication, advertising and marketing, delving into the big world of all that's around us in the media and what makes us tick as consumers. Throughout my entire life music has been a big passion of mine and a personal influencer, whether it be listening to as much music as I can in a day, right down to collecting audio equipment, although ironically I can only play the recorder\u2026 barely.\u202fI graduated from { Ulster University } [ Ulster University ] with a { BSc } [ Bachelor of Science ] { Biomedical Engineering } [ Biomedical engineering ] and now work at { Ulster University Students' Union } [ Ulster University Students' Union ]. I am on the hunt for a job for after I finish up at the end of June. Being involved in the { student } [ Student ] movement has exposed me to a wide variety of { people } [ People ] and { opinions } [ Opinion ]. I've been involved in { debate } [ Debate ] and have learned to be { sceptical } [ Skepticism ] of { headline } [ Headline ] figures.I am mad about { reading } [ Reading ] {. } [ Reading ] I fully believe it is an important life skill; I usually have a minimum of three books on the go. I enjoy dark humour, I'm not easily offended and spend an unhealthy amount of time on { YouTube } [ YouTube ] watching fan theory videos and { alternative media } [ Alternative media ] { podcasts } [ Podcast ].I'm currently { unemployed } [ Unemployment ] but would like to be a { youth worker } [ Youth worker ] in the future. I was inspired to do this after training with a local youth group, helping to facilitate volunteering and residentials.I live with my family but will be moving out soon to live with my boyfriend. We are expecting a baby, which we're excited about. I've felt disengaged with { politics } [ Politics ] in the past because I feel like I don't understand. I previously haven't voted but this year I definitely will, though I'm not sure who I will vote for.Having grown up in a community still bogged down in the quarrels and grievances of generations past, my aspiration is to ensure the stagnation that plagues { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] and the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] become less prevalent.My ideas seek to defy the scaremongering that politics is dominated by; to show the virtue of life outside of the { European Union } [ European Union ], to give a voice and represent the silent majority in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] who cannot be heard due to the noise of the vocal minority, and promote the value of education in healing the wounds and allowing our future generations to learn how not to repeat past mistakes. I hope to promote the idea that the { political } [ Politics ] process is not simply about the failings of { politicians } [ Politician ], but in achieving true progress for all.I am a highly political person who spends most of their free time campaigning on various political issues in and around { Belfast } [ Belfast ] city centre, most recently the closures to mental health day care centres. I am the vice president of the Belfast Met Titanic Quarter campus, a role which involves trying to keep the campus as inclusive as possible for the near 15,000 students from all walks of life who attend it, as well as representing them on a larger scale within NUS-USI. I am a fluent { Gaeilge } [ Irish language ] speaker having previously attended Colaiste Feirste, the only { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] medium secondary school in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ].I am originally from a little { village } [ Village ] outside of { Belfast } [ Belfast ] called { Crumlin } [ Crumlin, County Down ]. I'm currently in the process of studying for my { SAT } [ SAT ] exams and hope to be going to college in { American } [ United States ] starting in September 2017. The things I am most passionate about are { LGBT } [ LGBT ] rights and fighting for young people to have a voice. I first got involved with { politics } [ Politics ] at the age of 15 when I ran for { election } [ Election ] to represent young people from my area in the UK Youth Parliament. After being an elected member of Youth Parliament, I was elected on to the UKYP Procedures group, the governing body of the UK Youth Parliament.My involvement in youth politics has recently taken a more international turn after I became involved in the UK Young ambassadors programme which sees young people represent the UK on a { European } [ Europe ] level.I have been deeply interested and engaged in { politics } [ Politics ] for several years now, but I understand why many young people in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] feel put off. I am currently running to be a member of the UK Youth Parliament and my main areas of interest are in { education } [ Education ], { mental health } [ Mental health ], youth involvement in { politics } [ Politics ] and more recently the { EU } [ European Union ].I am very much looking forward to voting for the first time in the assembly elections this May, although I am still undecided on which party I am going to vote for. I feel that young people in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] are not consulted enough in the decision-making process and I would advocate the setting up of a youth assembly here to mirror the NI Assembly.I am the chair of the { Belfast City Council } [ Belfast City Council ] Youth Forum, as well as a peer advocate for children's rights with the Children's Law Centre. I am an executive committee member of the Northern Ireland Youth Forum, and also a Young Global Advocate with the Irish Development Education Association in the Challenging the Crisis global campaign. My campaigning in these areas has brought me to the { United Nations } [ United Nations ] Committee on the Rights of the Child in { Geneva } [ Geneva ], { Westminster } [ Westminster ], { Stormont } [ Stormont (UK Parliament constituency) ], and { India } [ India ]! I feel that my passion for justice has stemmed both from the principles instilled in me by my personal upbringing and my education, both of which taught me the value of every individual.I have a passion for the arts and so have been a member of a { drama school } [ Drama school ] called the Rainbow Factory for over eight years. I find that the { arts } [ The arts ] are great way for people young and old to express how we feel in a { creative } [ Creativity ] and { talented } [ Talent ] way. I currently work at YouthAction NI as a trainee administration assistant and I am uncertain about what I'd like to do in the future because I haven't tried everything yet. I am interested in { politics } [ Politics ] because as the next { generation } [ Generation ] we have a duty to improve our { society } [ Society ] for the better.\u00a0I am a { hip hop } [ Hip hop music ] { emcee } [ Rapping ] in a group called A Crew with Loose Screws. I came to { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] in the late 90s as a little kid and I grew up in East { Belfast } [ Belfast ]. I have been a victim of { racism } [ Racism ] and I have also seen the { city } [ City ] and its people embrace cultural difference in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] {. } [ Northern Ireland ]As { hip hop } [ Hip hop music ] { emcee } [ Rapping ] I have to talk to a lot of people so that I write songs that can change the { community } [ Community ] I live in. Over the years I have talked to people from different backgrounds for example { drug dealers } [ Illegal drug trade ], people who are on the brew for more than 20 years, and also people who fell { pregnant } [ Pregnancy ] as { teenagers } [ Adolescence ] and have to drop out of school to support their { children } [ Child ]. I tend to draw my influence from my { family } [ Family ] , { friends } [ Friendship ] and also my { community } [ Community ]. My family is love, my friends are loyalty and from my community I learn about the good, bad and ugly. From these three influences I have learned to respect others and also be a cool person with most of the people I meet.Eighteen years ago, I was born in { Ballymena } [ Ballymena ] and have lived there ever since. I'm currently applying for acting-related courses at various { universities } [ University ] which is a bit unusual for someone raised in an { engineering } [ Engineering ] family. One of the only interesting facts I can offer about myself is that I voluntarily drive a { Reliant } [ Reliant Motors ] Robin.My { Christian } [ Christianity ] faith is an integral part of who I am. It influences both my actions and my opinions. It also prompts me to try to understand and empathise with people around me. Perhaps that is why I love to act: I enjoy figuring people out.I'm a youth worker specialising in { mental health } [ Mental health ] and { masculinity } [ Masculinity ] using non-traditional approaches to challenge { stigma } [ Social stigma ] and { stereotype } [ Stereotype ]. For me, the outdoors and { nature } [ Nature ] are the great grounding forces which allow me to work most effectively with { people } [ People ] {. } [ Person ] Be that through bush craft or chasing adrenaline rushes in { climbing } [ Climbing ], I always seek innovative ways to educate and work with people.In rural { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] I have found no shortage of stigma to challenge and yet our politicians are often quite happy to rely on tribal voting to see them elected to office. The problem is it works, and I question at what point actually serving the { public } [ Public ] becomes a priority for these { public } [ Public ] representatives.My time at { university } [ University ] (particularly my involvement in a { debating } [ Debate ] society) has broadened my mind to an extent I never would have imagined possible, and has made me challenge every assumption I ever had. On the one hand, this has made me less certain about many things, but at the same time, it has meant that my opinions now have to be defensible to my harshest critic (myself).I believe people of every age, background and political persuasion could benefit from such exposure to views which make them question their own, because much of contemporary politics is built on ignorance and/or pessimism about the motives and principles of others.I am a first-year { journalism } [ Journalism ] student at the { North West Regional College } [ North West Regional College ] (NWRC) of { Londonderry } [ County Londonderry ], { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ]. I am an avid { Liverpool } [ Liverpool ] supporter and a self-confessed bookworm. A huge fan of { The Walking Dead } [ The Walking Dead (comic book) ] graphic novels and many of { Stephen King } [ Stephen King ] {'s } [ Stephen King ] books, I constantly try to keep up to date with the daily news via the { BBC } [ BBC ] website. While I am studying { journalism } [ Journalism ], I aspire to write a { novel } [ Novel ] at some point in the future.Within { politics } [ Politics ], I tend to vote on behalf of the { party } [ Political party ] that does the most for me as it gives me the belief that they are acting on the opinions of their voters.I'm a { trans } [ Transgender ] masculine person with the pronouns of he/his living in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] {. } [ Northern Ireland ] Right now, I'm in my first year of a level three B-Tech course in { TV } [ Television ] and { film production } [ Filmmaking ] which I hope to be my starting point for a\u202fcareer path in { writing } [ Writing ] and { art } [ Art ]. I have a strong interest in helping and working with the { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] community by making speeches, writing, drawing, and making documentaries. I hope to create better voices for the typically unheard, ignored parts of the { community } [ Community ] because I am affiliated with these people in my everyday life, knowing all too well how much it can hold us back from being listened to and accepted.I went to an { integrated } [ Racial integration ] { secondary school } [ Secondary school ] {. } [ Secondary school ] That is something that is really important to me and shapes my opinions. It also allows me to understand different { cultures } [ Culture ] and also to value others' { beliefs } [ Belief ] and { opinions } [ Opinion ]. I love the { arts } [ The arts ], { drama } [ Drama ], { dance } [ Dance ] and { singing } [ Singing ] - all this influence in my life and allows me to be creative and expressive. It lets me be who am I and I am very passionate about it.I am studying { history } [ History ], { politics } [ Politics ] and { geography } [ Geography ] at { A level } [ GCE Advanced Level ], and I'm hoping to go on to study { history } [ History ] and { politics } [ Politics ] at { Manchester Metropolitan University } [ Manchester Metropolitan University ] in September.I'm excited about voting for the first time in the upcoming assembly elections and in the EU referendum as I want to see the theories I have learnt about put into practice. I think { politics } [ Politics ] in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] really needs to change. Being involved in work with young people makes me want to make a change in politics so that more young people are involved in how our country is run.I am currently studying my final year of { A levels } [ GCE Advanced Level ] in { East Belfast } [ Belfast East (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency) ] {. } [ Belfast East (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency) ] Next year I hope to study { history } [ History ] at { university } [ University ] in { Scotland } [ Scotland ] {. } [ Scotland ]\u202f My interest in { politics } [ Politics ] stems from my belief that it is vital that my generation takes an interest in the world around us. { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] has one of the largest demographics of young people in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], yet most young people would agree that we aren't represented, which leads me to ask why?How is { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] to be progressive if its young people are not encouraged to stand up and speak, to help move our country forward? Something that is still needed, given our troubled past.\u202fI have spent my teenage years managing mental illness, and I now spend my spare time raising awareness re. young peoples' { mental health } [ Mental health ] {. } [ Mental health ] I am thoroughly disillusioned by { Northern Irish } [ Northern Ireland ] politics and as such put a lot of energy into pushing for change, i.e. marriage equality, alterations to abortion laws. I am an ordinary person, but it won't stop me trying to achieve the extraordinary.I'm an { English } [ England ] graduate and an avid reader and writer. I enjoy writing opinion pieces, { music } [ Music ] reviews and { book } [ Book ] reviews and I'm a big fan of { Caitlin Moran } [ Caitlin Moran ].I am currently studying for an { MA } [ Master of Arts ] { Politics } [ Politics ] at { Queen's University Belfast } [ Queen's University Belfast ] {. } [ Queen's University Belfast ] My political influences within { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] derived from my upbringing in a relatively { Unionist } [ Unionism in Ireland ] community, but since attending university, moving from a small town to the city, and travelling worldwide, I have broadened my political horizons and perspective on local issues with a more { liberal } [ Liberalism ] outlook.I was born and raised in a small { Unionist } [ Unionism in Ireland ]/ {Loyalist } [ Ulster loyalism ] estate in { Ballymena } [ Ballymena ] called the Doury Road. I am very into my politics, I'm in two marching bands, I'm also in the Apprentice Boys. I'm studying for a level 3 { diploma } [ Diploma ] in { business administration } [ Business administration ] and I work full-time Monday to Friday. My favourite activities are { marching } [ Marching ], watching { football } [ Association football ] and catching up with my { friends } [ Friends ].I'm a { history } [ History ] and { politics } [ Politics ] student.  I've been interested in { history } [ History ] my entire life, fascinated from an early age by { ancient Egypt } [ Ancient Egypt ] {. } [ Ancient Egypt ] My interests in { politics } [ Politics ] came later. The earliest bit of politics I can remember is 2007, when the { Northern Ireland Assembly } [ Northern Ireland Assembly ] was relaunched triumphantly. I remember cutting out the page from the paper that listed all the new MLAs. For me this was all new, I knew nothing about the { Good Friday Agreement } [ Good Friday Agreement ], or the previous { Stormont } [ Parliament of Northern Ireland ] administrations, I didn't even know about the original { Unionist } [ Unionism in Ireland ] parliament.As I continue in { life } [ Life ], however, this { optimism } [ Optimism ] is falling. Continually { Stormont } [ Parliament of Northern Ireland ] is looked upon as a joke, a large { sectarian } [ Sectarianism ] body of people only interested in themselves and their communities and that's what I want to see change.I was born in { Dagenham } [ Dagenham ], { Essex } [ Essex ] and lived there for two years before my family and I moved back to { Zambia } [ Zambia ] in { Africa } [ Africa ]. After spending six years in { Zambia } [ Zambia ] my mother got a job in { Ballyclare } [ Ballyclare ] {. } [ Ballyclare ] I attended Ballyclare High until I was 15 and then moved to Ballyclare Secondary School where I studied  business studies as well as a Level 2 and a Level 3 Diploma in sports coaching.I work in Cruise Fashion in { Victoria Square } [ Victoria Square, London ] and love my job. I really enjoy the { fashion } [ Fashion ] and { design } [ Design ] aspect of { retail } [ Retail ] as well as communication with the customers and my clients on a day-to-day basis. It is something I will definitely look into to progress in.I also have the intention of drawing attention to { racism } [ Racism ] in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] {. } [ Northern Ireland ] It is something that can be seen as a touchy subject that people would shy away from - but it is something that is still happening. Although times have changed and we seem to be getting with the times, it still happens. I was raised in { London } [ London ] before moving to { Belfast } [ Belfast ] where I spent the lion's share of my adolescence, I have fully embraced all the cultures I grew up in, whether they be { African } [ Africa ], { English } [ England ] or Northern Irish/Irish, so much so that they have shaped me as a person. My day-to-day interactions with these people of different { cultures } [ Culture ] have strongly influenced my { socio-political } [ Political sociology ] views. How I see the world in general and these factors as well as my own life experiences have inspired my music.I went to integrated nursery, { primary } [ Primary school ] and { secondary } [ Secondary school ] schools so integration is something that runs through my blood, it makes me the fair person that I am. I love anything technological, be that new { phones } [ Mobile phone ] or new pieces of { military } [ Military ] hardware, it's something I'm passionate about. Politics have always interested me. I make my { political } [ Politics ] choices and opinions by using a logical and thought out process.I attended Hazelwood Integrated College, a school which helped shape and support me throughout my education. Going to an { integrated } [ Racial integration ] school I was put into contact with people from { Catholic } [ Catholic Church ] backgrounds from an early age. This helped make me an { anti-sectarian } [ Anti-sectarianism ] {. } [ Anti-sectarianism ]\u202f I believe that in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] we need to overcome the divisions of the past in order to move forward and give the people of { NI } [ Northern Ireland ] something that they can be proud off.I support grassroots community action against cutbacks, { fracking } [ Hydraulic fracturing ] and { sectarianism } [ Sectarianism ]. I am active in several organisations which are trying to make { NI } [ Northern Ireland ] better for normal working people. Coming from a { working-class } [ Working class ] area I am seeing first hand the impact cuts have. { Having } [ Learning ] {\u202flearning } [ Learning ] difficulties, I find the cuts to { education } [ Education ] unacceptable.\u202fI'm a misfit and a { Queen's University } [ Queen's University Belfast ] { English } [ England ] scholar, { Belfast } [ Belfast ] born and bred. \"High Priestess Resurrected\" { blogger } [ Blog ] currently recovering from { anorexia nervosa } [ Anorexia nervosa ]. I believe in { communism } [ Communism ], { feminism } [ Feminism ], { vegetarianism } [ Vegetarianism ], tattooism and { tarot reading } [ Tarot card reading ]. \"Don't judge a book by its cover,\" is my mantra; despite the { punk rock } [ Punk rock ] hair and { Gothica } [ Gothica ] clothing, I'm actually a { classically } [ Classical music ] trained singer. Inspired by { Albert Camus } [ Albert Camus ], { Sylvia Plath } [ Sylvia Plath ] and WB Yeats. For too long the { eccentric } [ Eccentricity (behavior) ] {'s } [ Self-proclaimed ] voice has been silenced in the { media } [ Mass media ] {. } [ Self-proclaimed ] Now is the time for the outsiders to be heard.I live in a { rural } [ Rural area ] area in { County Fermanagh } [ County Fermanagh ] {. } [ County Fermanagh ] I am currently completing my A levels and hoping to find a summer job to earn some much needed cash. In the future, I would like to go into the area of youth work or media as I have regularly volunteered with local charities and think I have something to offer. I also volunteer in my local toddler and parent group and have raised money for local charities with the National Citizen Service.I see myself as an { environmentalist } [ Environmentalist ] {. } [ Environmentalist ] I believe that we hold a deep responsibility to { nature } [ Nature ] and the { government } [ Government ] has a major role to play in this. Living in such a beautiful country, I feel it is all our duty to protect it and being an avid { beekeeper } [ Beekeeper ] and stand-up paddle boarder I get to experience the beautiful land from different angles.The main issue that influences me is { education } [ Education ] in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] {. } [ Northern Ireland ] Despite { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] being in a relatively peaceful state, our { education } [ Education ] system still promotes division with the majority of our young people culturally and religiously segregated.\u202fI believe that teaching our children together is key to promoting a truly shared future and integrated education provides a foundation for peace and reconciliation that is unrivalled.\u202fI am in second year of studying biomedical science at { Ulster University } [ Ulster University ] and hope to continue on and complete a masters in { America } [ United States ]. I partake in extra-curricular activities such as { rugby } [ Rugby football ], ISOC (Islamic society) and also enjoy volunteering with St Johns Ambulance in my spare time. This also allows me to keep on top of my first aid skills.I personally do not have a lot of knowledge in politics but would like to. I feel that { politicians } [ Politician ] need to engage more with younger { people } [ People ] and explain better the issues they are going to tackle but also listen to what we would like and take the suggestions into consideration.I am currently completing my { undergraduate } [ Undergraduate education ] { degree } [ Academic degree ] at the { University of Aberdeen } [ University of Aberdeen ] {. } [ University of Aberdeen ]\u202f I hope to graduate in June with an { MA } [ Master of Arts ] in { history } [ History ] and { legal } [ Law ] studies. I have always had an interest in { politics } [ Politics ] and studied { British } [ United Kingdom ] and { American } [ United States ] { politics } [ Politics ] for A level. During my time in { Scotland } [ Scotland ] I have continued to keep a close eye on { local } [ Local government ] and { national } [ Government ] politics.At { university } [ University ] I volunteer as a transcriber for the Special Collections Centre in the Sir Duncan Rice Library. I enjoy working with { archives } [ Archive ] and hope to begin my masters in public history and { cultural heritage } [ Cultural heritage ] at { Trinity College Dublin } [ Trinity College Dublin ] in September. I also enjoy { public speaking } [ Public speaking ] and I have achieved my speech and { drama } [ Drama ] grade eight.I am in my second year studying { law } [ Law ] with { politics } [ Politics ] at { Queen's University } [ Queen's University Belfast ] {, Belfast } [ Belfast ]. I am very  interested in politics, active in my second consecutive year as an elected councillor on { QUB } [ Queen's University Birmingham ] Student's Union Council and I am the women's officer elect for { NUS-USI } [ National Union of Students-United Indies ]. Alongside this, I am involved in local party politics as the youth representative in my area.I enjoying judging and watching sheepdog trials and being home in the country!I have a passion to see changes in the political system for young people. Having been a young person brought up in { care } [ Health care ], I can see many failures in the system for { care } [ Health care ] experienced young people and { care } [ Health care ] leavers. My passion is to campaign for these changes to come about so that every care experienced young person will have the quality of life that they deserve to have and have access to services that will enable them to reach their full potential.My interests include watching crime detective programs, { travelling } [ Travel ], playing { musical instruments } [ Musical instrument ] and { boxing } [ Boxing ]. I took up { boxing } [ Boxing ] as a potential cure for some of the insecurity I experienced growing up in care. I did find a cure in it and actually found it very therapeutic. My first { White Collar } [ White Collar (film) ] fight was on 1 April.I am in my final year studying { history } [ History ] at { Queen's University Belfast } [ Queen's University Belfast ] {. } [ Queen's University Belfast ] For two years I have worked for my university's Widening Participation Unit which aims to remove barriers for young people pursuing higher education.  I work part-time as a { history } [ History ] { tutor } [ Tutor ] {. } [ Tutor ] I am currently training to become a { mentor } [ Mentorship ] for an { NGO } [ Non-governmental organization ] that works with young people. I am passionate about { education } [ Education ] and believe { students } [ Student ] should be given more choice in their { education } [ Education ] and that more needs to be done to help { pupils } [ Student ] from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.I believe that politics in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] should be less { tribal } [ Tribe ], so that people vote based on the future they want and not just because of the { community } [ Community ] they come from. As a former { English } [ England ] literature student, my political opinions have largely been shaped by the cuts to { education } [ Education ] and cuts to funding for the { arts } [ The arts ] which have seriously affected myself and other young people in my region. More broadly, I, like almost everyone in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ], have major concerns about the effectiveness of the current { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] government and its ability to deliver peace and prosperity to the region.I love the { cinema } [ Movie theater ] and going on { road trips } [ Road trip ] to anywhere. Since finishing { A levels } [ GCE Advanced Level ] last year I have completed a finance and administration { internship } [ Internship ] with YouthAction NI and I'm currently on the hunt for a job. My main hobby is { performing arts } [ Performing arts ] so if I'm not at home I'll be found in Rainbow Factory theatre, either helping out with front-of-house duties or on the stage.I am a first year { law } [ Law ] and { politics } [ Politics ] student at Queens University Belfast. Politics became apparent to me from a very young age, growing up in the political battleground of { County Antrim } [ County Antrim ], { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ]. Throughout my life, I've watched my country emerge from { war } [ War ] into { peace } [ Peace ], a phenomena that is very much an on-going process and not a singular event. My main political interests are the { European Union } [ European Union ], integrated education in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] and { judicial review } [ Judicial review ]. I'm a professional { barista } [ Barista ] but as much as I love { coffee } [ Coffee ] my dream job is to practice { law } [ Law ] as a { barrister } [ Barrister ].\u202fI am in my second year at { Queen's University Belfast } [ Queen's University Belfast ] where I study { politics } [ Politics ] and { philosophy } [ Philosophy ]. I write an opinion column in a local { newspaper } [ Newspaper ] which is great for venting frustration as well as drawing attention to overlooked issues and perspectives.Despite studying { politics } [ Politics ] and getting excited when my polling card arrives, I am increasingly disenfranchised. The younger generation is too often ignored until { politicians } [ Politician ] have no option other than to listen. I don't know if you can blame politicians themselves: with most being { middle-aged } [ Middle age ], { middle-class } [ Middle class ] and { male } [ Male ], they cannot represent the young voice as well as a younger { politician } [ Politician ] would.  Living in a rural area means I'm constantly aware of issues such as { infrastructure } [ Infrastructure ], { public transport } [ Public transport ], { healthcare } [ Health care ] and { education } [ Education ]. The big { cities } [ City ] are about 80 miles away and everything seems to be based in them. Those of us living in the back of beyond often miss out on opportunities because they're so inaccessible.I am a recent { journalism } [ Journalism ] { graduate } [ Postgraduate education ] currently working as a waitress until I find my first { graduate } [ Postgraduate education ] job. I am very proud to be from { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] and believe it is one of the best and most beautiful places to live. However, I believe there is much more to be done to make our little country stand out, as I would like to see the government do more to help the health sector as well as pass laws on gay marriage. This year I am looking forward to see how our country could change in both the { May elections } [ 2017 United Kingdom general election ] and the { EU referendum } [ 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum ].When I was 19 and my mum got ill, I fostered my 11-year-old brother and sister (they are twins) and have been their main carer ever since.  Looking after them keeps me busy, but I am otherwise unemployed.  I would love a job in youth work or counselling.I find the world of { politics } [ Politics ] fascinating. What intrigues me is its continually evolving nature and how virtually every decision affects us or someone close to us. My views are shaped by my interest in { history } [ History ] and the { Christian } [ Christianity ] values I uphold. Moreover, I am a { Unionist } [ Unionism in Ireland ] and I believe that by being part of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] is in the best position to prosper. Through the combination of being a { Unionist } [ Unionism in Ireland ], a { Christian } [ Christianity ] and a keen { historian } [ Historian ], I think it is fair to say that I have been moulded\u202finto having traditional views on politics and our world as a whole. Whilst I uphold my views strongly, I have a genuine interest in the views of others and am willing to listen, understand and respect.I am an { A level } [ GCE Advanced Level ] student at { Banbridge Academy } [ Banbridge Academy ], studying { English literature } [ English literature ], { history } [ History ] and { business studies } [ Business studies ]. My interest in { politics } [ Politics ] was sparked through the National Citizen Service. I have rose from being a participant to a leader and { alumni } [ Alumnus ] of the youth programme, and sat on the National Youth Board. These experiences gave me the confidence, the skills and the opportunity to visit { 10 Downing Street } [ 10 Downing Street ] and have breakfast with my local { MP } [ Member of parliament ] at { Westminster } [ Westminster ]. Since then I have been involved in the { Rotary } [ Rotary International ] Youth Leadership Development Competition where I was selected to be on a team visiting { Stormont } [ Stormont (borough) ], the Dail and the { European Parliament } [ European Parliament ]. Besides these amazing experiences that I have been lucky to have, I also enjoy the little things in life such as walking my dogs in fields and forests, and reading novels by { Nicholas Sparks } [ Nicholas Sparks ], { Becca Fitzpatrick } [ Becca Fitzpatrick ] and { Lauren Kate } [ Lauren Kate ].I am studying { A-level } [ GCE Advanced Level ] { politics } [ Politics ] part-time at { Belfast Metropolitan College } [ Belfast Metropolitan College ] {. } [ Belfast ] I am a member of my { student council } [ Student council ] and the current elected student governor. I hope to go on to study { politics } [ Politics ] at { Queen's University } [ Queen's University ] next year. I enjoy working with my student union to engage with other young people.I believe that the political situation in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] is utterly disengaged and unrepresentative of the majority of young people who live here. I find it completely unacceptable that we live in a society that continues to further ingrain { sectarianism } [ Sectarianism ], { homophobia } [ Homophobia ] and { sexism } [ Sexism ] within our society. I feel that our { government } [ Government ] makes little to no effort to engage with and educate young people politically, and that it is our obligation to prove that we do in fact care about our community by using our right to vote.I attended an { integrated } [ Racial integration ] secondary school which allowed me to understand other cultures within { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] and without that experience I would not have made the same friendships and relationships that I have today. The experience also allowed me to have a positive outlook on the future of { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ]'s political basis by trusting in the new generation of politicians.As a student { journalist } [ Journalist ], I hope to help my own age group by including some of { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ]'s own problems in my works. This includes { mental health } [ Mental health ] with young people, housing for students, especially in { Belfast } [ Belfast ], and last but not least { drug } [ Drug ] and { alcohol } [ Alcohol ] problems with young people. My interests are mainly { music } [ Music ] and { film } [ Film ] as I've always been the { quizmaster } [ Game show host ] on anything in those two categories.I am in my final year reading { Law } [ Law ] at { Queen's University } [ Queen's University Belfast ] {, Belfast } [ Belfast ] {. } [ Queen's University Belfast ] I am an alumna of the Study USA scholarship 2014/2015 at { Coe College } [ Coe College ] IA, where I majored in business with minors in political science and PR - and joined a sorority! Studying abroad provided me with exciting challenges and opportunities, and memories of new friends and cultural adventures.Having attended an integrated school ( {Belfast Royal Academy } [ Belfast Royal Academy ] {), } [ Belfast Royal Academy ] I believe { education } [ Education ] is the means to reconciliation in NI. I also believe in { devolution } [ Devolution ] and { self-governance } [ Self-governance ] {. } [ Self-governance ]Much to the chagrin of my friends, I'm rather the { rights } [ Rights ] { advocate } [ Advocate ] and { activist } [ Activism ]. I enjoy { volunteering } [ Volunteering ], { blogging } [ Blog ] and being involved in { student } [ Student ] organisations.I am studying { English } [ English language ] literature and geography at { A level } [ GCE Advanced Level ] over one year with the hope of studying { English } [ English language ] at { university } [ University ].I'm very passionate about { politics } [ Politics ] and I'm excited to vote for the first time in the upcoming { Northern Ireland Assembly } [ Northern Ireland Assembly ] Elections and in the { EU } [ European Union ] { referendum } [ Referendum ]; putting my theories into use. Politics in this country need to change; less looking through the green and orange tinted glasses of the past and more looking into the future. I believe the way to do this is through our youth and I'm excited and happy to get involved.I'm a masters research student in drama at University of Ulster Magee, although I'm based in { Comber } [ Comber ], just outside { Belfast } [ Belfast ]. I'm an ex-student of { Grosvenor Grammar School } [ Grosvenor Grammar School ] and currently I'm working part-time in { Holland } [ Holland ] and { Barrett } [ Barrett, Lancashire ] to help pay my way through my masters. Since I'm an arts student, I'm passionate about the promotion of the arts as a tool for social change and education; I do feel it's an under-used resource in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ], and a vital tool to help tackle { racism } [ Racism ], { sexism } [ Sexism ] and { sectarianism } [ Sectarianism ]. This all sounds very idealistic, but I've seen first-hand the differences that the arts can make in people's lives.I do love living in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ], but I admit I'm a little frustrated at the constant \"us-and-them\" dialogue in our politics, especially when I see it as unrepresentative of the majority of the young people's opinions.I'm a { sound engineer } [ Audio engineer ] and an avid campaigner for { human rights } [ Human rights ], specifically { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] rights. As part of the { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] community in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] I feel incredibly let down by our current political leaders who are showing no solidarity with young people nor the { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] community.I dedicate most of my time organising Foyle Pride Festival, which is totally voluntary. I also work two jobs so that myself and my girlfriend can live in our own place. Someday I hope to live in a progressive country where people can feel comfortable to be who they want and do what they want without question, and I'd like that place to be { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ]."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170126013934/http://www.bbc.com:80/news/uk-politics-32810887": "It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and exit to get { Brexit } [ Brexit ], in a same way as a possible { Greek } [ Greece ] exit from the euro was dubbed { Grexit } [ Grexit ] in the past.A { referendum } [ Referendum ] - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] should leave or remain in the { European Union } [ European Union ]. The { referendum } [ Referendum ] turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.4% to 46.6%, as did { Wales } [ Wales ], with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47. Scotland and { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] voted { Remain } [ Remain (Ireland) ] and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] - { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ]. The former { home secretary } [ Home Secretary ] took over from { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ], who resigned on the day after losing the { referendum } [ Referendum ]. Like Mr { Cameron } [ David Cameron ], Mrs { May } [ May ministry ] was against { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on { Brexit } [ Brexit ].The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the { Brexit } [ Brexit ] vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as { Easyjet } [ Easyjet ] and { John Lewis } [ John Lewis & Partners ] have pointed out that the slump in { sterling } [ Pound sterling ] has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the { FTSE 100 } [ FTSE 100 Index ] and the broader { FTSE 250 } [ FTSE 250 Index ] index, which includes more { British-based } [ United Kingdom ] businesses, trading higher than before the { referendum } [ Referendum ]. The { Bank of England } [ Bank of England ] cut { interest rates } [ Interest rate ] from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] economy is doingThe { European Union } [ European Union ] - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 { European } [ Europe ] countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after { World War Two } [ World War II ] to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a \"single market\" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the { euro } [ Euro ], which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the { environment } [ Environmentalism ], { transport } [ Transport ], consumer rights and even things such as { mobile phone } [ Mobile phone ] charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called { Article 50 } [ Withdrawal from the European Union ] of the { Lisbon Treaty } [ Treaty of Lisbon ] which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the { negotiations } [ Brexit negotiations ]. The { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] will also enact a { Great Repeal Bill } [ Great Repeal Act 2017 ] which will end the primacy of { EU law } [ European Union law ] in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into { UK } [ United Kingdom ] law in one lump, after which the { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.After a court battle, the UK's { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ] has ruled that { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked.This means legislation will be prepared for { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] and { Lords } [ House of Lords ] to vote on. The verdict was not what the { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] argued for, but { ministers } [ Minister (government) ] have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.Most { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered {, } [ Article 50 of the Constitution of the United Kingdom ] although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation {. } [ Article 50 of the Constitution of the United Kingdom ]Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] MP and { Leave } [ Leave (UK) ] campaigner { David Davis } [ David Davis (British politician) ], to take responsibility for { Brexit } [ Brexit ]. Former defence secretary, { Liam Fox } [ Liam Fox ], who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and { Boris Johnson } [ Boris Johnson ], who was a leader of the official { Leave } [ Brexit ] campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the { Three Brexiteers } [ Three Brexiteers ] - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be { Mrs May } [ May ministry ] {, } [ May ministry ] as prime minister {, } [ May ministry ] who will have the final say. The { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] did not do any emergency planning for { Brexit } [ Brexit ] ahead of the { referendum } [ 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum ] and Mrs { May } [ Elizabeth May ] has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.Once Article 50 has been triggered, the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the { Brexit } [ Brexit ] process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former { Foreign Secretary } [ Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ] { Philip Hammond } [ Philip Hammond ], now { Chancellor } [ Chancellor of the Exchequer ], wanted { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued.EU law still stands in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by { EU } [ European Union ] treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.Unpicking 43 years of { treaties } [ Treaty ] and { agreements } [ Contract ] covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along.Following { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ]'s { Brexit } [ Brexit ] recent speech we now know that the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] is not intending to stay in the EU's { single market } [ European Single Market ]. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the { European Court of Justice } [ European Court of Justice ] and having to allow unlimited { EU } [ European Union ] immigration, under { freedom of movement } [ Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union ] rules.Both sides want trade to continue after { Brexit } [ Brexit ] with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services\" - such as those in the { City of London } [ City of London ] and wanting a \"comprehensive free trade deal\" giving the UK \"the greatest possible access\" to the { single market } [ European Single Market ]. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A { customs union } [ Customs union ] is where countries agree not to impose { tariffs } [ Tariff ] on each others' goods and have a common { tariff } [ Tariff ] on goods coming in from elsewhere. The { UK } [ United Kingdom ] is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could { customs union } [ Customs union ] work?These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] departure from the { EU } [ European Union ]. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] relationship with the { EU } [ European Union ] post- {Brexit } [ Brexit ].So at one extreme, \"hard\" { Brexit } [ Brexit ] could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the { EU } [ European Union ] { single market } [ European Single Market ]. At the other end of the scale, a \"soft\" { Brexit } [ Brexit ] might follow a similar path to { Norway } [ Norway ], which is a member of the { single market } [ European Single Market ] and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of { British } [ United Kingdom ] nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the { Home Office } [ Home Office ] has said.A lot depends on the kind of deal the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] agrees with the { EU } [ European Union ] {. } [ European Union ] If it remains within the { single market } [ European Single Market ], it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose { work permit } [ Work permit ] restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning { Britons } [ United Kingdom ] would have to apply for { visas } [ Travel visa ] to work.Again, it depends on whether the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] government decides to introduce a { work permit } [ Work permit ] system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary { David Davis } [ David Davis (British politician) ] has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as { Brexit } [ Brexit ] nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a \"surge\" in new arrivals.People travelling overseas from the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] have found their pounds are buying fewer { euros } [ Euro ] or { dollars } [ United States dollar ] after the { Brexit } [ Brexit ] vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the { pound } [ Pound (currency) ] regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term.This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between { Tesco } [ Tesco ] and { Marmite } [ Marmite ] {'s } [ Marmite ] makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.The latest UK { inflation } [ Inflation ] figures, for December, showed the { CPI } [ Consumer price index ] { inflation } [ Inflation ] rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.Prime Minister { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] has said one of the main messages she has taken from the { Leave } [ Brexit ] vote is that the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people want to see a reduction in { immigration } [ Immigration ].She has said this will be a focus of { Brexit } [ Brexit ] negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other { EU } [ European Union ] nations will grant the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of { EU } [ European Union ] citizens to live and work in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ].Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a \"sustainable\" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are { EU } [ European Union ] citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the { EU } [ European Union ] - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of { UK } [ United Kingdom ] citizens.It seems highly unlikely. Both the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] and the { Labour Party } [ Labour Party (UK) ] have ruled out another { referendum } [ Referendum ], arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people who clearly voted to Leave. The { Liberal Democrats } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt { Brexit } [ Brexit ] and keep { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] in the EU if they were to win the next general election.Some commentators, including former { House of Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ] clerk { Lord Lisvane } [ Robert Lisvane, Baron Lisvane of Wallasey ], have argued that a further { referendum } [ Referendum ] would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.Yes. { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] has said there will be a { Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ] and { Lords } [ House of Lords ] vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the { European Parliament } [ European Parliament ] - with { British } [ United Kingdom ] { MEPs } [ Member of the European Parliament ] getting a chance to vote on it there.While there could be limitations on { British } [ United Kingdom ] nationals' ability to live and work in { EU } [ European Union ] countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter { tourists } [ Tourism ]. There are many countries outside the { European Economic Area } [ European Economic Area ], which includes the 28 EU nations plus { Iceland } [ Iceland ], { Lichtenstein } [ Lichtenstein ] and { Norway } [ Norway ], that { British } [ United Kingdom ] citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with { European } [ Europe ] countries.Yes. It is a { British } [ United Kingdom ] document - there is no such thing as an { EU } [ European Union ] { passport } [ Passport ], so your { passport } [ Passport ] will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for { EU } [ European Union ] countries, says the { BBC } [ BBC ]'s { Europe } [ Europe ] correspondent, { Chris Morris } [ Chris Morris (journalist) ].The { single market } [ Single market ] is seen by its advocates as the { EU } [ European Union ] {'s } [ European Union ] biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a { free trade } [ Free trade ] area in { Europe } [ Europe ] before it joined what was then known as the { common market } [ European Economic Community ]. In a { free trade area } [ Free-trade area ] countries can trade with each other without paying { tariffs } [ Tariff ] - but it is not a single { market } [ Market (economics) ] because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The { European Union } [ European Union ] single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the { European Union } [ European Union ], as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a { business } [ Business ] or take a { job } [ Job ] anywhere within it. The idea was to boost { trade } [ Trade ], create { jobs } [ Job ] and lower { prices } [ Price ]. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a \"level playing field\".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. But { Greenland } [ Greenland ], one of { Denmark } [ Denmark ] {'s } [ Denmark ] overseas territories {, } [ Denmark ] held a referendum in 1982 {, } [ Denmark ] after gaining a greater degree of self government {, } [ Denmark ] and voted by 52% to 48% to leave {, } [ Denmark ] which it duly did after a period of negotiation {. } [ Denmark ] The { BBC } [ BBC ]'s { Carolyn Quinn } [ Carolyn Quinn ] visited { Greenland } [ Greenland ] at the end of last year to find out how they did it.Scotland's { First Minister } [ First Minister of Scotland ] { Nicola Sturgeon } [ Nicola Sturgeon ] said in the wake of the Leave result that it is \"democratically unacceptable\" that { Scotland } [ Scotland ] faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to { Remain } [ United Kingdom Remain ]. A second { independence } [ Independence ] { referendum } [ Referendum ] for the country is now \"highly likely\", she has said, although not in { 2017 } [ 2017 South African general election ] {. } [ 2017 South African general election ] She has said she wants { Scotland } [ Scotland ] to stay in the { single market } [ European Single Market ] and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the { single market } [ European Single Market ] \"undoubtedly\" brings the { referendum } [ Referendum ] closer.Before his resignation Deputy First Minister { Martin McGuinness } [ Martin McGuinness ] said the impact in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] would be \"very profound\" and that the whole island of { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] Secretary, { Theresa Villiers } [ Theresa Villiers ] ruled out the call from { Sinn F\u00e9in } [ Sinn F\u00e9in ] for a { border } [ Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border ] poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land { border } [ Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border ] is likely to be a key part of the { Brexit } [ Brexit ] talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the { EU } [ European Union ] which allowed a common travel area between the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and the { Republic of Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] {. } [ Republic of Ireland ]During the { referendum } [ Referendum ] campaign, { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] said the so-called \"triple lock\" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which { pensions } [ Pension ] increase by at least the level of earnings, { inflation } [ Inflation ] or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ], which is due to last until 2020.So far there has been a cut in { interest rates } [ Interest rate ], which has helped keep { mortgage } [ Mortgage loan ] and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising { inflation } [ Inflation ] have worried the { Bank of England } [ Bank of England ]  enough to consider raising { interest rates } [ Interest rate ].  But if that happened it would make { mortgages } [ Mortgage loan ] and { loans } [ Loan ] more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.Journalists and writers on { social media } [ Social media ] have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an \"upside\" or \"silver lining\" of { Brexit } [ Brexit ] {. } [ Brexit ] As with most { Brexit } [ Brexit ] consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the { EU } [ European Union ] play out - whether the \"customs union\" agreement between { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { EU } [ European Union ] is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss { Jacques Gounon } [ Jacques Gounon ] said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be \"an incredible boost for my business\" but he later said  that remark had been \"light-hearted\". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote \"it is not possible to predict how { Brexit } [ Brexit ] will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.\"They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The { EHIC } [ European Health Insurance Card ] card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the { EU } [ European Union ], as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the { European Economic Area } [ European Economic Area ], often simply referred to as the { single market } [ European Single Market ] (plus { Switzerland } [ Switzerland ], which confusingly is not a member of the { EEA } [ European Economic Area ], but has agreed access to the { single market } [ European Single Market ]). Therefore, the future of { Britons } [ United Kingdom ]' { EHIC } [ European Health Information Centre ] cover could depend on whether the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] decided to sever ties with the { EEA } [ European Economic Area ].Probably not, says { BBC Europe } [ BBC Europe ] correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The { DVLA } [ Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ] says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the { Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ], given that a lot of MPs - all { P } [ Party of Labour (UK) ] and { Lib Dems } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ], nearly all { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] and many { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] still has to pass the laws that will get { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] - the { House of Lords } [ House of Lords ] and/or the { Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ] could vote against ratification, according to a { House of Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ] library report. In practice, { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] who voted to remain in the EU would be { whipped } [ Whip (politics) ] to vote with the { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ]. Any who defied the { whip } [ Whip (politics) ] would have to face the wrath of voters at the next { general election } [ General election ].One scenario that could see the { referendum } [ Referendum ] result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the { referendum } [ Referendum ] one. Two-thirds of { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] would have to vote for a { general election } [ General election ] to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.The { European Court of Human Rights } [ European Court of Human Rights ] ( {ECHR } [ European Court of Human Rights ]) in { Strasbourg } [ Strasbourg ] is not a { European Union } [ European Union ] institution.It was set up by the { Council of Europe } [ Council of Europe ], which has 47 members including { Russia } [ Russia ] and { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] {. } [ European Union ] So quitting the { EU } [ European Union ] will not exempt the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the { Human Rights Act } [ Human Rights Act 1998 ] which requires UK courts to treat the { ECHR } [ European Convention on Human Rights ] as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a { British Bill of Rights } [ United Kingdom Bill of Rights ].As part of that, the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in { England } [ England ] and { Wales } [ Wales ] to over-rule judgements handed down by the { ECHR } [ European Convention on Human Rights ].However, the EU has its own { European Court of Justice } [ European Court of Justice ] {, } [ European Union ] whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and { member states } [ Member state of the European Union ] {. } [ European Union ]Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and supporters of a { Brexit } [ Brexit ] have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers.BBC { Europe } [ Europe ] editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no { rebate } [ Rebate (marketing) ], and enter accession talks with the { EU } [ European Union ]. Every { member state } [ Member state ] would have to agree to the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in { Europe } [ Europe ], other leaders might not be generous towards any { UK } [ United Kingdom ] demands. New members are required to adopt the { euro } [ Euro ] as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] could try to negotiate an { opt-out } [ Opt-out ] {. } [ Opt-out ]The { UK Independence Party } [ UK Independence Party ], which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in { May's general election } [ May 2016 United Kingdom general election ], has campaigned for many years for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the { Conservative Party } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] {'s } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] MPs, including { Boris Johnson } [ Boris Johnson ] and five members of the then { Cabinet } [ Cabinet of the United Kingdom ]. A handful of { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] MPs and { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] party the { DUP } [ Democratic Unionist Party ] were also in favour of leaving.They said { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] was being held back by the { EU } [ European Union ], which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited { sovereignty } [ Sovereignty ] and { democracy } [ Democracy ], and they wanted { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of { EU } [ European Union ] membership is \"free movement\", which means you don't need to get a { visa } [ Travel visa ] to go and live in another { EU } [ European Union ] country.Then { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other { European Union } [ European Union ] leaders that would have changed the terms of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] \"special\" status and help sort out some of the things { British } [ United Kingdom ] people said they didn't like about the { EU } [ European Union ], like high levels of { immigration } [ Immigration ] - but critics said the deal would make little difference. The { Conservative Party } [ Conservative Party of Canada ] was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The { Labour Party } [ Labour Party (UK) ], { Scottish National Party } [ Scottish National Party ], { Plaid Cymru } [ Plaid Cymru ], the { Green Party } [ Green Party of Scotland ] and the { Liberal Democrats } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] were all in favour of staying in.US president { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] also wanted { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as { France } [ France ] and { Germany } [ Germany ].Those campaigning for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to stay in the { EU } [ European Union ] said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other { EU } [ European Union ] countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Four of the biggest { US } [ United States ] { banks } [ Bank ] have committed to helping maintain the { City } [ City ]'s position. But { HSBC } [ HSBC ] will move up to 1,000 jobs to { Paris } [ Paris ] {, } [ London ] the { BBC } [ BBC ] understands.Some { UK } [ United Kingdom ] exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. { Pest } [ Pest, Hungary ] control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make \u00a315m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at { UK } [ United Kingdom ] cosmetics firm { Lush } [ Lush (company) ] said the company was \"terrified\" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's { Dorset } [ Dorset ] factory would continue to produce goods for the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] market, products for the { European } [ Europe ] market may be made at its new plant in { Germany } [ Germany ].Yes, says { BBC Europe } [ BBC Europe ] editor { Katya Adler } [ Katya Adler ] {. } [ Katya Adler ] There will still be 27 other { EU } [ European Union ] states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be { English } [ English language ] - \"much to { France } [ France ] {'s } [ France ] chagrin\", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any { company } [ Company ] wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a { company } [ Company ] would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:The good news for Edward, from { Cambridge } [ Cambridge ], who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from { Hornchurch } [ Hornchurch ] - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only { France } [ France ] and { Germany } [ Germany ] contribute more. In 2014/15, { Poland } [ Poland ] was the largest beneficiary, followed by { Hungary } [ Hungary ] and { Greece } [ Greece ].The UK also gets an annual { rebate } [ Rebate (marketing) ] that was negotiated by { Margaret Thatcher } [ Margaret Thatcher ] and money back, in the form of { regional development } [ Regional development ] grants and payments to farmers, which added up to \u00a34.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest { Treasury } [ HM Treasury ] figures, the { UK } [ United Kingdom ]'s net contribution for 2014/15 was \u00a38.8bn - nearly double what it was in { 2009/10 } [ 2009\u201310 FTSE 100 Index ].The { National Audit Office } [ National Audit Office (United Kingdom) ], using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to { private sector } [ Private sector ] companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was \u00a35.7bn. Read more number crunching from { Reality Check } [ Reality Check (magazine) ].David, from { East Sussex } [ East Sussex ], is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large { British } [ United Kingdom ] expat community in { Spain } [ Spain ] gets free access to { Spanish } [ Spain ] GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the { NHS } [ National Health Service ]. After they become permanent residents { Spain } [ Spain ] pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other { EU } [ European Union ] countries.If { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] remains in the { single market } [ Single market ], or the { European Economic Area } [ European Economic Area ] as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a { House of Commons } [ House of Commons of the United Kingdom ] library research note. If { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the { NHS } [ National Health Service ] or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.Dee, from { Launceston } [ Launceston, Cornwall ], wanted to know what would happen to { EU } [ European Union ] laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] leaving the { EU } [ European Union ]. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the { Leave } [ Brexit ] vote, the { government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.The status of { Special Areas of Conservation } [ Special Area of Conservation ] and { Special Protection Areas } [ Special Protection Area ], which are designated by the { EU } [ European Union ], would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to { European Protected Species } [ European Protected Species ] legislation, which relate to { bats } [ Bat ] and their { habitats } [ Habitat ] {. } [ Bat ]The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.Martin, from { Poole } [ Poole ], in { Dorset } [ Dorset ], wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] in { Brussels } [ Brussels ]. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about \u00a330m.But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the { cost of living } [ Cost of living ] in the { countries } [ Country ] where the { children } [ Child ] live. { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] could lose an average of \u00a36,000 a year of in-work benefits when his \"emergency brake\" was applied. The { DWP } [ Department of Water and Power ] estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got { tax credits } [ Tax credit ] and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The { plan } [ Plan ] will never be implemented now.Sophie from { Peterborough } [ Peterborough ], who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] { Eurovision } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] fan club, who says: \"All participating countries must be a member of the { European Broadcasting Union } [ European Broadcasting Union ]. The EBU - which is totally independent of the { EU } [ European Union ] - includes countries both inside and outside of the { EU } [ European Union ], and also includes countries such as { Israel } [ Israel ] that are outside of { Europe } [ Europe ]. Indeed the UK started participating in the { Eurovision Song Contest } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] in { 1957 } [ Eurovision Song Contest 1957 ], 16 years before joining the then { EEC } [ European Economic Community ] {. } [ European Economic Community ]\"As with most elements of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the { Brexit } [ Brexit ] effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to \"uncertainty\" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] in the three months after the { referendum } [ Referendum ] vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in { London } [ London ] and { East Anglia } [ East Anglia ], surveyors predict.Separate figures from property portal { Rightmove } [ Rightmove ] suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in { England } [ England ] and { Wales } [ Wales ] fell by 0.9%, or { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]2,647, in July compared with { June } [ June UK general election ]. It said that { agents } [ Law of agency ] had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a { mortgage } [ Mortgage loan ] and hope to leave homes as { inheritance } [ Inheritance ] would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.Ged, from { Liverpool } [ Liverpool ], suspects \" {red tape } [ Red tape ]\" is a { euphemism } [ Euphemism ] for employment rights and { environmental protection } [ Environmental protection ]. According to the { Open Europe } [ Open Europe ] { think tank } [ Think tank ], four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK { renewable energy } [ Renewable energy ] strategy, which the { think-tank } [ Think tank ] says costs \u00a34.7bn a year, tops the list.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future { UK } [ United Kingdom ] government reproducing these regulations in { British } [ United Kingdom ] law following the decision to { leave } [ Brexit ] the { EU } [ European Union ]. And the costs of so-called \"red tape\" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] opted to follow the \"Norway model\" and remained in the { European Economic Area } [ European Economic Area ] most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or { TTIP } [ Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ] - currently under negotiation between the EU and { United States } [ United States ] will create the biggest { free trade } [ Free trade ] area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ], believe it could make { American } [ United States ] imports cheaper and boost { British } [ United Kingdom ] exports to the { US } [ United States ] to the tune of \u00a310bn a year.But many on the { left } [ Left-wing politics ], including { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] leader { Jeremy Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ], fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.Quitting the { EU } [ European Union ] means the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] will not be part of { TTIP } [ Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ].Paddy, from { Widnes } [ Widnes ], wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the { NHS } [ National Health Service ].This became an issue in the { referendum } [ Referendum ] debate after the { Leave } [ Brexit ] campaign claimed the money { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] sends to the EU, which it claims is \u00a3350m a week, could be spent on the { NHS } [ National Health Service ] instead. The { BBC } [ BBC ]'s { Reality Check } [ Reality Check (TV series) ] team looked into this claim.Health Secretary { Jeremy Hunt } [ Jeremy Hunt ] warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.Former { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] health secretary { Lord Owen } [ Alan Owen ] has said that because of { TTIP } [ Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ] (see answer above) the only way to protect the { NHS } [ National Health Service ] from further privatisation was to get out of the EU."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20160501035529/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-35799468": "They represent a cross-section of 16 to 25-year-olds in { Scotland } [ Scotland ], and will be involved in debates and discussions in { BBC } [ BBC ] coverage of the election.These youngsters are from a diverse range of backgrounds and communities.Here you'll find the whole group, introducing themselves to the nation in their own words.Join the conversation with @BBCGen2016 and find out more at bbc.co.uk/generation2016.I'm studying { sociology } [ Sociology ] and { politics } [ Politics ] at { university } [ University ] where I am the women's officer.

I am a campaigner for { equality } [ Social equality ] {. } [ Social equality ] I pushed for the creation of an { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] group in my school and I'm being trained to deliver workshops to school about the { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] community. There needs to be a broader { education } [ Education ] within { schools } [ School ] - specifically with { sex education } [ Sex education ] in relation to { LGBT+ } [ LGBT ] students.In my opinion, the current { government } [ Government ] needs a shakeup. Younger people have become disengaged from politics and are drastically underrepresented. I feel that the country needs a { politician } [ Politician ] that everyday people can relate to, who knows the struggles people go through and can inspire people to become engaged not only in { politics } [ Politics ] but in their { communities } [ Community ].I am studying { film } [ Film ] and { media } [ Mass media ] at the { University of Stirling } [ University of Stirling ] and hope to work in the { creative industries } [ Creative industries ] one day. I like to keep busy being involved in lots of activities such as { Scouts } [ Scouting ], the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and Haggeye, a campaign project for blind and partially sighted young people. I enjoy getting involved in and having my say on changes which affect me and think it is important for everyone to have a voice. My main political interests revolve around issues surrounding { working class } [ Working class ] matters and general perceived { social inequalities } [ Social inequality ]. These form my background and are what shape my opinions and core beliefs.I'm a first year at the { University of St Andrews } [ University of St Andrews ] reading { economics } [ Economics ] and { international relations } [ International relations ]. Outside of university and politics, I play the { bagpipes } [ Bagpipes ] for { Denny } [ Denny, Falkirk ] and { Dunipace } [ Dunipace ] Pipe Band. Growing up in { Ross-Shire } [ Ross-Shire ] in the { Highlands } [ Scottish Highlands ] of { Scotland } [ Scotland ], and as a fiddle player, a highland dancer and a { Gaelic } [ Scottish Gaelic ] speaker, I am keen to keep hold of { Scottish } [ Scotland ] culture, particularly the { Gaelic } [ Scottish Gaelic ] language. Having gone through Gaelic-medium education, I feel I have benefitted greatly from this style of education that is available to all in { Scotland } [ Scotland ]. I wish people throughout the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] could receive similar opportunities that are so easy to make use of. By giving more people the chance to get ahead in life, I believe we can create a fairer and a more equal society that would be of benefit to all.I've been interested in { politics } [ Politics ] above virtually all else for several years now. I've managed to do a lot of things to pursue my interest already - I managed to attend { Prime Minister's Questions } [ Prime Minister's Questions ] a few years back, and more recently I did work experience in the { House of Commons } [ House of Commons of Canada ]. I find that { politics } [ Politics ] seeps into my various other interests as well - for example, I've been trying to figure out for months how to create a { Holyrood } [ Holyrood, Edinburgh ] parliamentary seat calculator.Looking at various documentaries and mulling over people's thoughts on { Twitter } [ Twitter ] has likely impacted my political opinions most, but with much of my family being doctors, I've been hugely influenced on health policy as well.I am a newly qualified { midwife } [ Midwife ] {. } [ Midwife ] I love hill walking, { dogs } [ Dog ], craft beer, and { Taylor Swift } [ Taylor Swift ].

Growing up in a deprived area has had significant influence on my opinions both { politically } [ Politics ] and non-politically. I can see the downward spiral and the breakdown of communities caused by lack of job opportunity and prosperity in the area and I feel this is caused by regeneration projects being concentrated in large urban areas rather than smaller towns facing real deprivation. I hope the next government puts the { social welfare } [ Welfare ] of the { population } [ Population ] first.I study { social sciences } [ Social science ] at { Glasgow Caledonian University } [ Glasgow Caledonian University ] but would like to have an influence in { politics } [ Politics ] at some stage in life. Throughout the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] we see { poverty } [ Poverty ] and { corruption } [ Corruption ] on a mass scale, and not a lot seems to be done about it. This is why I think voters are becoming disengaged with politics completely. Voters young and old are turning away from decision-making that overwhelmingly influences their lives. Over the past year or so we have seen { referendums } [ Referendum ] and { elections } [ Election ] that have attracted many millions as I believe people are tired with establishment { politics } [ Politics ] and { politicians } [ Politician ]. I would love to see { democracy } [ Democracy ] continue to thrive in the way it has in the past few months.I'm in my final year at { secondary school } [ Secondary school ], and am going on to { university } [ University ] in September to study { politics } [ Politics ], { international relations } [ International relations ] and { French } [ French language ]. My hobbies include listening to { music } [ Music ] (a wide variety of genres), playing the { violin } [ Violin ], { cinema } [ Film ] and I am fascinated by { aviation } [ Aviation ]! { Politics } [ Politics ] has always interested me because I see it as a way by which people's lives and larger society can be improved. However, I don't believe that this is happening at the moment.My opinions and thoughts are to a certain extent shaped by what I see and hear on { television } [ Television ] { news } [ News ] and { current affairs } [ Current affairs (news format) ] programmes, and also by healthy debate with my peers. I have also had first-hand experience of { local } [ Local government ], { national } [ National government ] and { international } [ International relations ] politics through work experience in a { local } [ Local government ] constituency office.I was born in { DR Congo } [ Democratic Republic of the Congo ] but moved to { Glasgow } [ Glasgow ] at the age of three as an asylum-seeker and now call { Scotland } [ Scotland ] my home. I am a very bubbly and happy person who loves to interact and socialise with people. My family have been involved in international politics and my father has many strong opinions on political matters. His views and political interests have, in a way, rubbed off on me as I have grown up - however, I still having my own opinions and views. Living in { Glasgow } [ Glasgow ], where there are so many different { races } [ Race (human categorization) ] and { religions } [ Religion ], also gives me an open mind. The { First Minister } [ First Minister of Scotland ], { Nicola Sturgeon } [ Nicola Sturgeon ], is my school's local { MSP } [ Member of the Scottish Parliament ], which means I have met her a few times.I was born in { Worcester } [ Worcester ] and moved to { Scotland } [ Scotland ] when I was nine. I have also lived for some time in the { USA } [ United States ]. At present I am a bar manager in an eco community in { Scotland } [ Scotland ] called { Findhorn } [ Findhorn ]. I have a great interest in { politics } [ Politics ] and I consider myself to be rather { left wing } [ Left-wing politics ] {. } [ Left-wing politics ] I am aspiring to be an adult { nurse } [ Nursing ] so I can help people the way my nurses have helped me. I also play { netball } [ Netball ] for my local ladies team, which is very rewarding.I'm a floating voter and on the run up to elections I try to research the different parties and their policies as much as possible. Recently, it's mainly the parties' { economic } [ Economy ] policies that sway my opinion on them, as I believe it to be one of the most important things.I'm a first year { English } [ English language ] { literature } [ Literature ] student at { Glasgow University } [ University of Glasgow ] {. } [ University of Glasgow ] I have developed my { political philosophy } [ Political philosophy ] by being involved in { Glasgow University Union } [ Glasgow University Union ] Debating and arguing with other debaters. I have come to the conclusion that above all else I value choice. However, what makes me not a { libertarian } [ Libertarianism ] is that I believe the { state } [ State (polity) ] has a role to play in helping people make the most of the freedoms they have. I am ecstatic about being able to vote in this election, because voting to stay part of a country and then being told you're not old enough to vote for that country's government is infuriating.I live in { Govan } [ Govan ], my interests are going to the { cinema } [ Movie theater ], going out for dinner, visiting family and friends and going to { college } [ College ] where I study { social sciences } [ Social science ]. My favourite part of it is { psychology } [ Psychology ] {. } [ Psychology ]I am from one of the most { rural } [ Rural area ] places to live in { Scotland } [ Scotland ] {. } [ Scotland ] I am in S4 in { Anderson } [ Anderson, South Carolina ] { High School } [ Secondary school ] and it will be my first time voting in an { election } [ Election ]. I started to become more interested in { politics } [ Politics ] between the ages of 12 and 14 and I tried to learn more about it. Ever since the { Scottish independence } [ Scottish independence ] { referendum } [ Referendum ] I have been hooked into { politics } [ Politics ] {. } [ Politics ] I believe that { Scotland } [ Scotland ] should be an independent country that has the right to { self-determination } [ Self-determination ] but I do always look at political matters from a level perspective while listening to all of the different parties' views.I am studying music at { West College Scotland } [ West College Scotland ] in { Greenock } [ Greenock ] {. } [ Greenock ] \u00a0I'm looking forward to starting first year at { Aberdeen University } [ University of Aberdeen ] in September.\u00a0Although my main focus is my { music } [ Music ] I have a strong passion for { politics } [ Politics ] and enjoy debating current issues and events. \u00a0I've been fortunate to live a fairly settled home life but have had experience of social injustices and have seen firsthand how lack of employment and a lack of compassion can very quickly affect a person's wellbeing and sense of importance.I believe that we all have an important part to play in society and issues close to my heart include: the { NHS } [ National Health Service ], the plight of the { Syrian } [ Syria ] people, lack of funding in { education } [ Education ] and the inequality of the sexes.I like making { short films } [ Short film ] and taking { pictures } [ Photograph ]. My hobbies are going out with { friends } [ Friendship ] and going to the { cinema } [ Movie theater ] {. } [ Movie theater ] I want to become a { director } [ Film director ] in the { future } [ Future ] {. } [ Future ] I live on my own. I love { movies } [ Film ] and like meeting new { people } [ People ].I'm a { politics } [ Politics ] and { sociology } [ Sociology ] student from the { Scottish Highlands } [ Scottish Highlands ] {. } [ Scottish Highlands ] I've been all over the { political spectrum } [ Political spectrum ], however my previous political allegiances had been for the wrong reasons. Life events have strongly shaped my views, whether it be starting my own business or becoming a wheelchair user. Having proven my views wrong to myself, I came to realise there is no room for idealism any more and frequently decisions have to be made because they are the least worst option available at the time as populist polices often cause unseen harm. It was at this point where I realised that despite opinions of others, having the facts behind you is the only way politics can work.I'm a { Polish-American } [ Polish Americans ], non-UK citizen, and have lived my entire life in this beautiful country. Scotland is my home.I've been studying { geology } [ Geology ] at { St Andrews } [ University of St Andrews ] for three and a half years. Reading about past { climate change } [ Climate change ] events, and low oil price, leads me to believe { Scotland } [ Scotland ] should be a world leader in { green technologies } [ Environmental technology ]. I unfortunately suffer from { anxiety } [ Anxiety ] and { depression } [ Depression (mood) ], and support for { mental health } [ Mental health ] is a great issue to me, something { Scotland } [ Scotland ] could do better. I find modern history fascinating; learning of { Poland } [ Poland ]'s struggle over the past 200 years to gain { autonomy } [ Autonomy ] and rekindle its { democracy } [ Democracy ] made me interested in { politics } [ Politics ]. Everyone - absolutely everyone - should have a say in how their country is run. I can't vote in general elections or in the forthcoming { EU } [ European Union ] referendum: it is an unjust { inequality } [ Social inequality ], and I believe modern society is rife with { inequality } [ Social inequality ], a problem that must be tackled.I'm a { political activist } [ Activism ] from { Fife } [ Fife ], { Scotland } [ Scotland ]. I first got involved in { politics } [ Politics ] in late 2014 when I stood for the { Scottish Youth Parliament } [ Scottish Youth Parliament ] {. } [ Scottish Youth Parliament ] I campaigned hard in my home { constituency } [ Electoral district ] throughout the { general election } [ General election ] campaign. When not talking about { politics } [ Politics ] (which is hardly ever), I'm taking part in my roles as a director of our local Youth Arts Hub, and a member of Kirkcaldy Youth Action.I live with my { mother } [ Mother ], who I care for, and my younger { sister } [ Sister ]. I am currently studying for my { HNC } [ Higher National Certificate ] in care and administrative practice and I thoroughly enjoy my work placement. My sister is soon to sit her exams and  I take a keen interest in her education. I am looking to progress on to a { university } [ University ] to study { midwifery } [ Midwifery ] in September, to further my { education } [ Education ] and lead to a career in the { health care } [ Health care ] sector. I moved house a year ago and have worked very hard to get to where I am. I studied modern studies so thoroughly enjoy debates and have done public speaking with Fife Young Carers Focus Group.I'm in sixth year at { school } [ School ] and in September I'll be going to { university } [ University ] to study { international relations } [ International relations ] and { politics } [ Politics ]. In 2015 I became a member of the { Scottish Youth Parliament } [ Scottish Youth Parliament ] as one of the first representatives for { Scouts Scotland } [ Scouts Scotland ], an organisation I have been part of for over 10 years. So far the experience has been great and I love representing { Scouts } [ Scouting ]. Being part of such a huge { international organisation } [ International organization ] brings lots of opportunities. In 2015 I went to { Japan } [ Japan ] for three weeks for the { 23rd } [ 23rd World Scout Jamboree ] { World Scout Jamboree } [ World Scout Jamboree ] {. } [ World Organization of the Scout Movement ] For part of the trip, I lived with a { Japanese } [ Japan ] family in the city of { Yokohama } [ Yokohama ] which was an unforgettable experience.Mental health services and youth work are important to me and my main political influences are my family, current events and the media. I play several instruments: { piano } [ Piano ], { guitar } [ Guitar ], { bass guitar } [ Bass guitar ], { double bass } [ Double bass ] and { cello } [ Cello ]. I am a member of Na Seudan \u00d9r, a folk band that performs both { Gaelic } [ Scottish Gaelic ] and { Scots } [ Scottish people ] music in a funky, jazzy way. We began performing and entering contests in 2009, when I was nine. Na Seudan \u00d9r has been very successful, winning the National Mod and producing a CD that has sold worldwide.My other interests are { writing } [ Writing ], { filming } [ Filmmaking ] and { photography } [ Photography ]. This started when I was very young; I used to make { short films } [ Short film ] with my { dogs } [ Dog ] as the main characters. I work for Argyll Youth Arts as a channel manager, producing films promoting and showcasing youth arts in my area, with support from a group of volunteer filmmakersFh. I'm also busy with my Highers.I hail from the { Isle of Lewis } [ Isle of Lewis ] in the { Western Isles } [ Outer Hebrides ] of { Scotland } [ Scotland ].  I currently study { Gaelic } [ Scottish Gaelic ] media in the { Isle of Skye } [ Isle of Skye ] {. } [ Isle of Skye ] I am fortunate to be a native { Gaelic } [ Scottish Gaelic ] speaker, and { Gaelic } [ Scottish Gaelic ] culture has always been important to me. Politically, I value the importance of { education } [ Education ] and more { investment } [ Investment ] into young people, in particular { apprenticeship } [ Apprenticeship ] and traineeship schemes. I also have concerns about the { environment } [ Natural environment ], and believe in { gender equality } [ Gender equality ] {. } [ Gender equality ]I'm a 19-year-old bi guy, who lives in { Perth } [ Perth, Scotland ], is from { Dunfermline } [ Dunfermline ] but was born in { England } [ England ]. I'd like to say I was apolitical, but I have voted a similar way in the elections I've voted in. My views have been influenced a lot by my parents, my { Green } [ Green Party of England and Wales ]-supporting mother and { socialist } [ Socialism ] father, but I wouldn't say I agree necessarily with either. I'm also interested in our political relations with { China } [ China ], down to my involvement with SCEN, an organisation which promotes learning about { China } [ China ] in schools.I am a { history } [ History ], { politics } [ Politics ] and professional education student teacher at { Stirling University } [ University of Stirling ] {. } [ Stirling ] I'm very active in the { political } [ Politics ] world, a believer in { grassroots } [ Grassroots ] politics and a young { trade unionist } [ Trade union ] {. } [ Trade union ] My passion is rooted in my personal experiences, which include { homelessness } [ Homelessness ], { poverty } [ Poverty ], living with family members who suffer from { mental illness } [ Mental disorder ] and { addiction } [ Addiction ] and how { education } [ Education ] has transformed and saved my life.I am passionate about young people; education; ending stigmas towards { mental health } [ Mental health ] and { homelessness } [ Homelessness ]; challenging { sexist } [ Sexism ] attitudes and { bullying } [ Bullying ]; and about my community. I've been on a very active, unusual and emotional political journey at just 18, with being surrounded by many known politicians and leaving a party to join another just this year. I always believe that you should stand up for your values, even if that means standing alone.I spent four years studying economic and social history at Glasgow Uni which I loved and which gave me a good basis of understanding about the history of { British } [ United Kingdom ] politics and the formation of the { European Union } [ European Union ] etc. However I have never been particularly politically active and certainly don't spend my free time researching different arguments and canvassing my local neighbourhood! I'm most passionate about equality between the genders and ages, and fairness in the world of work.I am a member of the { Scottish Youth Parliament } [ Scottish Youth Parliament ] though in this capacity I am non-party political. My interest in { politics } [ Politics ] first began two years ago when I joined the Aberdeenshire Youth Council and I realised that young people have the power to make a difference in their future. I think we should encourage investment in { renewable energy } [ Renewable energy ] and ensure that the future of the north east is not reliant on the oil price. I believe we should scrap the trident programme and use the money to invest in the infrastructure of { Scotland } [ Scotland ]'s cities and schools.I applied for BBC Generation as I felt that my community was not acknowledged very much in any political affairs. By applying and being accepted I feel now that I can be apart of the beginning of publicising my community's opinion. My personal opinions on different topics vary depending on the relevance today and how it is affecting the world. I take everyone into account in my opinion and how it would benefit everyone including myself. I also believe the way my parents raised me to be the mature and educated individual that I am really is a factor in how I think of certain topics and I sometimes agree or disagree with what my parents think.As a young carer (my brother has { autism } [ Autism ]), I'm passionate about ensuring that options and services are provided for those with { disabilities } [ Disability ] and their families. The lack of services available in { Scotland } [ Scotland ] has greatly affected my family. I volunteer with a community organisation that helps young adults with PMLD (profound and multiple learning disabilities). I care about { education } [ Education ] and I think it is very important, so I'm in favour of free university tuition. I hope to study { history } [ History ] at university, but I also love { politics } [ Politics ], { philosophy } [ Philosophy ] and { music } [ Music ]. My views tend to be { left wing } [ Left-wing politics ]. I sometimes find that it is difficult to find information on current issues, such as the { EU } [ European Union ] and the { NHS } [ National Health Service ], and I think that more awareness should be raised among young voters.I am a second year sport and exercise student at { Edinburgh Napier University } [ Edinburgh Napier University ] {. } [ Edinburgh Napier University ] I am an { MSYP } [ Scottish Junior School of Music ] for { Edinburgh } [ Edinburgh ] Pentlands. In the { Scottish Youth Parliament } [ Scottish Youth Parliament ] I am also the convenor for the sport and leisure committee. This allows me to work closely with like-minded people who are passionate about sport.I have been given the amazing opportunity to be one of the young ambassadors for the 2018 European Championships which I am very excited about. I enjoy the competitive and { social } [ Social ] aspect of { sport } [ Sport ].

I regularly work with young people from areas of the city with typically high amounts of { social } [ Social inequality ] and { economic inequality } [ Economic inequality ] as part of the Children's Holiday Venture. I also work part-time at White Stuff in the city centre. Having a younger brother with { Down Syndrome } [ Down syndrome ] {, } [ Down syndrome ] I have always been involved with different inclusion initiatives in various different capacities.Growing up, I've had a strong connection with music. I've played as part of { ensembles } [ Musical ensemble ] as well as working for various different { arts } [ The arts ] groups. I write a { music } [ Music ] { blog } [ Blog ] that discusses live { music } [ Music ] of all descriptions. As a { Christian } [ Christianity ], my { faith } [ Faith ] has deeply impacted my understanding of the world around me and has encouraged me to take on challenges such as { humanitarian aid } [ Humanitarian aid ] trips to { Honduras } [ Honduras ].I was born in { Poland } [ Poland ] but moved to { Scotland } [ Scotland ] when I was six. I got into { politics } [ Politics ] during the { 2014 independence referendum } [ 2014 South African independence referendum ] {. } [ South African Republic ] My top political issues in this election are { education } [ Education ] and { housing } [ Housing ], as they are two sections of society which have been neglected under the current governments. I am in { high school } [ Secondary school ], and will finish my { Highers } [ Secondary school ] next year.I'm a fifth year { high school } [ Secondary school ] { student } [ Student ] from { Dundee } [ Dundee ] {. } [ Dundee ] I'm a floating voter and like many other young people I support parties depending on specific policies, although I avoid the far-right, always. The international side of things fascinates me. I can't help but love debating and discussing current foreign affairs. This doesn't mean I'm not interested in { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and local politics, I really do like to see how who we support affects us on a daily basis. I'm influenced by { family } [ Family ], but I'm always ready to argue against them, and what I learn at { school } [ School ] and from the { news } [ News ], but not so much that it will drastically change my own opinions without good reason. Aside from { politics } [ Politics ] I'm a very chatty person who loves to play { sports } [ Sport ] and run.I am currently in S5 at { Preston Lodge High School } [ Preston Lodge High School ] and I am a first-time voter. I have always been interested in { politics } [ Politics ] and particularly the impact it has on people's lives. In recent years I have become very interested in the impact of { education } [ Education ] on { young people } [ Youth ] and their future opportunities. Coming from a { state } [ State school ] { school } [ School ] that has recently improved but still needs work, I have experienced many changes. This has led me become passionate about the matters of widening participation and equal opportunities for all. Due to recent circumstances I have had many dealings with the { NHS } [ National Health Service ]; this has led me to strongly support the { NHS } [ National Health Service ] and keeping it in public hands. Furthermore, my { Christian } [ Christianity ] faith helps shape my opinions on these matters.I am in my final year at { Edinburgh University } [ University of Edinburgh ] studying { computer science } [ Computer science ] and { electronics } [ Electronics ], and when I graduate I hope to become a digital hardware engineer. In my free time I enjoy { football } [ Association football ] {, } [ Reading ] reading {, } [ Reading ] and keeping up with current affairs.I became interested in { politics } [ Politics ] accidentally, pulled in by the { Scottish } [ Scotland ] independence { referendum } [ Referendum ]. I have always considered myself to be a { liberal } [ Liberalism ], believing that { freedom } [ Freedom ] is the most important value for individuals and { society } [ Society ] to hold. I believe that a { liberal } [ Liberalism ] society is the most desirable for young people, as it allows us to choose our own path in life and not be shackled by the circumstances of our birth. My hope is that the next { Scottish Parliament } [ Scottish Parliament ] will be about fixing our country's problems and not continuing our obsession with the constitution.I love { films } [ Film ] and { music } [ Music ] more than anything else, with my favourite { director } [ Film director ] being { Martin Scorsese } [ Martin Scorsese ].  When I finish { school } [ School ], I'd like to go on to study { software } [ Software ] { engineering } [ Engineering ] {. } [ Software engineering ]  I am in my fifth year at Calderhead High School in { Shotts } [ Shotts ], where I am a \"violence reduction mentor\".  This means I talk to pupils in lower years, to give them advice and support about { bullying } [ Bullying ], issues around { consent } [ Consent ], and other sensitive subjects. I'm currently taking a { gap year } [ Gap year ] before going to study { psychology } [ Psychology ], { sociology } [ Sociology ] and { politics } [ Politics ] at university. I spent January travelling in { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ] and I am planning to go to { America } [ United States ] to travel and work at a { summer camp } [ Summer camp ]. I feel very passionately about { feminism } [ Feminism ] and { human } [ Human rights ] and { animal rights } [ Animal rights ]. I have always enjoyed { singing } [ Singing ] and { acting } [ Acting ] - { music } [ Music ] is a big influence for me, as are my { family } [ Family ] and { friends } [ Friends ].I am considering a few career choices, including { psychologist } [ Psychologist ], but what I would most like to do is be a personal and social education { teacher } [ Teacher ]/guidance { teacher } [ Teacher ]. I think it is important that children have a positive role model and are taught about topics such as { mental illness } [ Mental disorder ], { drugs } [ Drug ], { sex } [ Sex ] and { bullying } [ Bullying ].I am studying { multimedia } [ Multimedia ] { journalism } [ Journalism ] at { university } [ University ] and I am thoroughly enjoying my course even though it requires a lot of hard work. I became interested in { politics } [ Politics ] through { modern } [ Modern history ] studies at { school } [ School ]. It was one of my favourite subjects and I feel it is what pushed me to look at { journalism } [ Journalism ] as a career. I work part-time at the { gym } [ Gym ] on my { university } [ University ] { campus } [ Campus ]. I enjoy working there and am one of those strange people who like to be kept busy.After training in { martial arts } [ Martial arts ] for 11 years I spend my Saturday mornings coaching children aged four to 14 and, despite how stressful it can be, it is also extremely rewarding. Music is another passion; nothing beats the rush of seeing one of your favourite bands live.I am taking my { A levels } [ GCE Advanced Level ] and hoping to study { chemistry } [ Chemistry ] or { teaching } [ Education ]. I enjoy { gaming } [ Video game ] and I am open to trying new things. I have always been interested in { science } [ Science ] and { politics } [ Politics ] {. } [ Politics ] This is mainly due to both of the subjects having such large fields of study and each can be looked into in such depth. My opinions in { politics } [ Politics ] are very free-form and gathered from mainly the { internet } [ Internet ] and { newspapers } [ Newspaper ], which I read daily. Overall, I would say I am a floating voter who votes on the facts, not the emotion.I'm a final year undergraduate student at { Aberdeen University } [ University of Aberdeen ] studying { international relations } [ International relations ] and { Hispanic } [ Hispanic ] studies. I call home { Dunblane } [ Dunblane ] where I went to school and my family still live, however I've been fortunate enough to travel the world a bit and I like to think I have made a few other homes (including { Honduras } [ Honduras ], { El Salvador } [ El Salvador ] and { Sevilla } [ Seville ]).I am very interested in domestic and international politics, { international development } [ International development ] and aid, patterns of { migration } [ Human migration ], and issues in { Central America } [ Central America ]. Personally I would identify as somewhere on the { left } [ Left-wing politics ] of the { political spectrum } [ Political spectrum ], though currently a bit disenfranchised from the { parties } [ Political party ] and leaders on offer.There are so many things which shape and influence my opinions, but right now I'd rank { environmental } [ Natural environment ] change and { humanitarian } [ Humanitarianism ] issues as the two areas of { policy } [ Policy ] I care most about. A large part of my free time is spent volunteering with { Girlguiding } [ Girlguiding ] (I lead a { Brownie } [ Brownies (Scouting) ] group) and getting angry about social injustice. My views are wholly shaped by the activism and research I've done with { Girlguiding } [ Girlguiding ], on gender-related inequality issues, and also from my own life - I grew up in a single-parent household in { Glasgow } [ Glasgow ]. I proudly identify as a { feminist } [ Feminism ] and have done for a number of years, and this has really shaped my worldview and politics. My involvement in politics before now is limited and I am trying to understand as much as I can, particularly with the { Holyrood } [ Holyrood, Edinburgh ] elections and { European } [ European Union ] referendum looming. I think people my age felt their voices weren't heard, and there is an excitement that we have been given this opportunity to vote at 16. However, there still seems to be a real lack of information regarding { politics } [ Politics ] within the { curriculum } [ Curriculum ] {. } [ Curriculum ] Votes of younger people are important; they will help to shape the future of { Scotland } [ Scotland ], and { Great Britain } [ Great Britain ].I am particularly passionate about { education } [ Education ] within { Scotland } [ Scotland ]; it is evident that many { children } [ Child ] are held back due to lack of choices. This is important, these children could potentially change { Scotland } [ Scotland ], given the opportunity.I'm a third year { philosophy } [ Philosophy ] and { literature } [ Literature ] student at the { University of Edinburgh } [ University of Edinburgh ] {. } [ University of Edinburgh ] I help organise Soapbox, the { University of Edinburgh } [ University of Edinburgh ] {'s } [ University of Edinburgh ] fortnightly open mic, the most regular slam in the country. I'm also one of the core organisers behind the { spoken word } [ Spoken word ] { collective } [ Collective ] Loud Poets. Recently I was part of the winning team from { Edinburgh University } [ University of Edinburgh ] at the national competition { UniSlam } [ UniSlam ].I'm a frequent { chess } [ Chess ] player, a passionate { chemist } [ Chemist ], a steadfast { libertarian } [ Libertarianism ] thinker and an unwavering { Eurosceptic } [ Euroscepticism ].  I live in the small, traditional fishing village of { Port Seton } [ Port Seton ], { East Lothian } [ East Lothian ]: nothing is more delightful than than the sight of { Scottish } [ Scotland ] sand and sea. I am a collector of { World War II } [ World War II ] military relics, taking particular interest in artefacts connected to the rise and fall of the { Third Reich } [ Nazi Germany ]. I received a certificate for my essay on the { EU } [ European Union ] - The Rape of Europa - in the Scottish Schools' Young Writer of the Year 2016.I recently moved out of my parents' house and into a nice wee house with my boyfriend. I left school when I was 15 and now I work in a { call centre } [ Call centre ] for a { bank } [ Bank ], which is pretty good because I like talking, a lot. I've no idea what I want to do in the future though. I'd like to work with young carers but I can't seem to stick in at college to get there!I've been a carer for my mum and my brother for my whole life, and I want to raise awareness of carers - in particular young adult carers - as I feel that the government doesn't do nearly enough for us."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20150526221307/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32852570": "In his first interview since that moment two weeks ago, the man who thought he was about to be { chancellor } [ Chancellor ] told me about his \"sense of loss\" after his party's failure and a personal defeat which he describes as \"a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy\".Ed Balls was in reflective mood when we spoke - looking back at what he'd achieved as much as forward to what might be next.\"I think one of the really important things in life is to think about what you've done rather than fixate on what you might not have done,\" he said.\"So in those 20 years, I helped keep us out of the euro, I helped { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to have an independent { Bank of England } [ Bank of England ], to raise education leaving age to 18, { Sure Start } [ Sure Start ], the national minimum wage, changing the health service - these are all good things.\"We didn't get everything right. We did some good things and I'm proud of what I've done and the decisions I've made.\"When he lost his seat he thought back to the day he was first elected and gave his rather startled { Tory } [ Tory ] successor a word or two of advice on how she should handle her victory speech and the waiting media.Balls told me that it was not until the early hours of Friday that he knew he'd lost.I asked what his emotions were at that moment, if there were tears.He replied: \"I've been around for a long time so I've seen wrenching political change and I've seen people be surprised by outcomes. a year ago, two years ago it was a really hard thing for us to do to win this election.\"Five years ago coming out of { government } [ Government ] after the { financial crisis } [ Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 ] {, } [ Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 ] I think many people thought it was an impossibility {. } [ Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 ]\"In the final weeks we fought a good campaign and we were neck and neck in the poll. I think we thought there was a chance. But I think over the course of that night, as the results came in, we knew that chance had alluded us and it wasn't anger or tears, more a dawning disappointment and sense of loss.\" {Balls } [ Ed Balls ] is not yet ready to to step back into { Westminster } [ Westminster ] - we spoke overlooking the { City of London } [ City of London ] - but is he ready to accept the blame for what went wrong for him and his party?When I asked him whether \" {Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] was one of the reasons { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] was unelectable?\" he replied: \"Of course. I mean { Ed Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ] said straight after the { election } [ 2010 United Kingdom general election ] he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of  responsibility. In the end he didn't persuade people he could be the { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] but I didn't persuade people I could be the { chancellor } [ Chancellor ] either.\"I have to take that on the chin. { People } [ People (magazine) ] will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for { me } [ Me (magazine) ]. That's something I might do in future, might come back to. Not now. It's for others to go for the instant commentary and work out the next steps for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] and the country.\"It is though pretty clear who he blames for one vital mistake made by his party - the failure to woo business.\"I think I wanted to be more pro-business but I also backed { Ed Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ] 100 per cent. He was the leader, I was the shadow chancellor. We both worked very hard and in the end neither he or I persuaded people and we need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.\"It was { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] though who was { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ]'s key economic adviser in the run up to the Great Crash and there's one question which has haunted him and his party - Did { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] spend too much in government? Why did { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] enter that crisis with a budget deficit and not a surplus ?\"Before 2007 it is a matter of record that we had a low level of national debt because of the decisions we had made but also we had a small deficit.\"People will now say that that small deficit should have had a small surplus. The reality is that would have made a small difference, not a big difference, that couldn't have made a difference to the global financial crisis, which was a huge failure in our banking system and a failure of regulation which I have taken on the chin for the last ten years. In the end though we didn't convince people of that argument, but i am afraid those are the facts.\"Just as he leave frontline politics his wife - { Yvette Cooper } [ Yvette Cooper ] - is stepping forward to take over as the next { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] leader.He told me she is \"brilliant and people will get a chance to see what she stands for\" but he insisted that \"I am not playing a role in her campaign\" except \"whilst she is busy I can do more to help family.\"Asked whether whether he worries that she is applying for the toughest job in { British } [ United Kingdom ] politics he said: \"You have to take your calling when it comes.\"What though of his future - ever since he was a student { Balls } [ Balls, Jr. ] has had politics in his blood - is he really going to walk away from it now?\"I'm not going to be dashing back\" to front-line politics, { Balls } [ Balls, Jr. ] says, before swiftly adding but \"never say never\".He was, he told me, embarking on \"a new chapter, outside of { politics } [ Politics ].

Outside of { politics } [ Politics ] is where I am going next.\"What, though ,of rumours that he fancies an appearance on { Strictly Come Dancing } [ Strictly Come Dancing ] - a prospect his wife has described as \"truly terrifying\"?Despite running three marathons he told me \"I'm not sure if I'm equipped for { Strictly } [ Strictly Come Dancing ]\" - a non-denial denial if ever I heard one.I very much suspect we have not seen the last { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] moment.Here is the full transcript of the interview: {Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ]: Clearly I've got more time on my hands than I've had for the past 20 years, it's only been a couple of weeks, it's flown by.  I've had hundred of letters and emails from { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] voters and { Tory } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] voters - I've been replying to them.  I've been trying to get fit again, get back to { piano } [ Piano ] practice, my oldest daughter is doing the { GCSE } [ General Certificate of Secondary Education ] now, with Yvette very busy at the moment there's a bit more time for me to spend with the family and also outside of the day to day there's a bit more space.  I've been thinking about and writing about { economics } [ Economics ] for 20 years and there's really big issues out there, what's happening to secular stagnation, is the financial system sound - the development challenge which is pushing migrants into { Europe } [ Europe ] - these are things where for the first time there's real time to stand back and think and write a bit, that's what I'm doing.Nick Robinson: That sounds like there's a book coming or a series of lectures, we've not heard the end of { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] on { economics } [ Economics ]?EB: It's a new chapter for me, and it's a big change. {  } [ I ] { I } [ I ] think . you never know what's going to be happening in the future, I'm not going to be standing for a { by-election } [ By-election ] \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and while you never say never I think for me the reality is the next phase for me is going to be outside of politics, but there's ways in which you can make a difference in the world outside of { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ] and that's something I'd like to do - who knows if there'll be a chance to be in public service again in the future, but for me now . out of { politics } [ Politics ] is where it is.maybe. after a breather you won't be back.EB: I came into { politics } [ Politics ] to make a difference, and that's what I've tried to do in my life.  And I think one of the really important things in life is to think about what you've done rather than fixate on what you might not have done.  So in those 20 years I helped keep us out of the { Euro } [ Euro ], I helped { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] to have an independent { Bank of England } [ Bank of England ], to raise education leaving age to 18, { Sure Start } [ Sure Start ], the national minimum wage, changing the health service - these are all good things.  We didn't get everything right, we did some good things and I'm proud of what I've done and the decisions I've made. But it is a different chapter for me now, and there's big issues out there in the world that I'd like to think about to write about to get involved in.  I don't know where it's going to take me but it's new and a change and I'm still fairly young.  I'm looking forward to it, it's exciting.NR: No { House of Lords } [ House of Lords ]?EB: Out of { politics } [ Politics ] is how I'm thinking of things at the moment.NR: Not running a { think tank } [ Think tank ]?EB: Look you never say never about anything 'cos who knows what's going to happen - it's only been a couple of weeks, but I think the reality for me now is that I want to make a difference to the world outside of politics - that's how I'm thinking about things - I'm not going to dashing back.NR: The big question everybody says I have to ask you is Strictly. Are you going to take to the ballroom floor?EB: Three marathons means I am fit but am I really fit enough for { Strictly } [ Strictly Come Dancing ]? When you look at it, the people who on { Strictly } [ Strictly Come Dancing ], they tend to be half my age and to have played international sport or been to stage school or on the stage.\" am not sure if I am quite equipped for Strictly.NR: { Vince Cable } [ Vince Cable ], { Ann Widdecombe } [ Ann Widdecombe ] did it, surely { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] can do it?EB: (sounding uncertain): Errrr., OK, OK.NR: Let me take you back two weeks ago - many people thought you were about to be chancellor of the exchequer, did you - even on Thursday night?EB: We knew it was really close, and before that exit poll all the opinion polls said the election was on a knife edge.I'm not sure if it was more than 50% but I thought it was a real possibility.  So to go from that through the { exit poll } [ Exit poll ], that swing to the { conservatives } [ Conservatism ] through to losing my seat in seven hours. In { 2010 } [ 2010 United Kingdom general election ] I held on, I think in { 2015 } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] the { Tories } [ Tory ] were as surprised as I was by what happened in my { constituency } [ Electoral district ] and in seats across the country, so it was a big change.NR:  So within the space of a day, you went from thinking I might be standing outside No11 to being redundant?EB: Politics is a brutal business and it is tough, as { Robin Day } [ Robin Day ] famously said us politicians can be here today and gone today, and that's what happens.  But in the end the reason is because we live a { democracy } [ Democracy ] and in a { democracy } [ Democracy ] the { people } [ People ] decide.  And however tough it is for us individual politicians - especially if you're fighting a  marginal seat like mine - you can be here today and gone tomorrow and that is democracy.  So in the end, although was hard for me, I am a symbol of the vibrancy of our democracy. { And } [ And (song) ] that's something { I } [ I (1996 film) ] think people are proud of {, } [ And (song) ] and celebrate {, } [ And (song) ] and although hard for { me } [ I (1996 film) ] . it shows the kind of { country } [ Country ] we live in.NR:  You were also a symbol too of { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] {'s } [ Labour Party (UK) ] defeat, some people said it was like the { Portillo } [ Roberto Portillo ] moment for the { Tories } [ Tory ]. Does that hurt that there were people saying 'Yes! { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] has gone?'EB: The thing which hurts is the fact the millions of people who voted for us, and many thousands of people who worked to campaign for a { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] govt were disappointed because we didn't succeed, and we didn't convince people that we were the right people to be in govt.  And as I said on the night, such big issues for our country - whether we stay in the { European Union } [ European Union ], whether we can hold our union together, the depth of public spending cuts { George Osborne } [ George Osborne ] is planning and the risk to the national heath service and I can't now change that course and that direction.  In that sense there are very many people who wanted us to succeed and we didn't and my disappointment is much much more about the result about what happened to the government than anything to do with my, that is really secondary.  That is how I felt in those moments, when I found out my result,  I already knew what was happening in the country - and that was a much bigger deal.Repeat of last question due to plane noise.EB: There are very many millions of people who voted for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ], many thousands who worked hard for a { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] govt because they wanted us to win.  And the disappointment is that we didn't convince enough people that we could be the next govt, that they could trust in us.  And it means that on those big issues facing our country whether we can save our national health service , whether we can keep our union together, whether or not we can keep { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] in the { European Union } [ European Union ] and reform { Europe } [ Europe ].  We now can't chart that course.  And for me that disappointment is much much bigger than anything personally that happened to me - I knew for hours that night what was happening in the country.  And by the time it came to my speech, what happened in the country was a much much bigger sense of sorrow than anything personal, that wasn't the issue for me.NR: You knew for hours that you might lose but not days, when did you first realise that you might lose?EB: I didn't know that I was actually going to lose my seat until the returning officer gave us the result at 7.30 in the morning, so { I } [ I (1996 film) ] had hours of uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I think the point where { I } [ I (1996 film) ] knew that things were not turning out the way in which we hoped, when { we } [ We (1996 film) ] knew . was not the exit poll, it was probably results from { Wrexham } [ Wrexham (UK Parliament constituency) ] and { Nuneaton and Swindon North } [ Nuneaton and Swindon North (UK Parliament constituency) ] about 1 in the morning which showed a swing from { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] to the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ].  My seat was a very marginal seat, in { 2010 } [ 2010 United Kingdom general election ] we just held on. I always knew if { Tories } [ Tory ] had a majority I was probably a goner but the reason I travelled seven and a half thousand of miles and went to 45 seats because I was fighting to win but only when it dawned in those hours after 1 in the morning that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 actually things had not gone the way anybody had expected and the { conservatives } [ Conservatism ] might get to a majority it was that point where I started to think well maybe my seat might go as well.   By then though, it was clear that { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] wasn't going to be the govt and that was a much bigger deal for me.NR: And your emotion when you realised that - shock, anger, tears?EB: I've been around for a long time so I've seen wrenching political change and I've seen people be surprised by outcomes. a year ago, two years ago it was a really hard thing for us to do to win this election. Five years ago coming out of { government } [ Government ] after the { financial crisis } [ Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 ] I think many people thought it was an impossibility. In the final weeks we fought a good campaign and we were neck and neck in the polls I think we thought there was a chance. But I think over the course of that night as the results came in we knew that chance had alluded us and it wasn't anger or tears more a dawning disappointment and sense of loss.NR: A loss for what might have been?EB: Yeah of course because look we worked so hard for so long to try and win people's trust to convince people and there were so many people relying on us to do so and even now, since the election many more people come up to me to say we're really sorry or this is how we felt and you can feel that sense of disappointment and that's hard because I wanted to win.NR: You must ask yourself again and again why and - this is hard question -  do you ever look at yourself and think maybe { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] was one of the reasons { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] was unelectable?EB: Of course. I mean { Ed Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ] said straight after the { election } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] he took responsibility but all of us have to bear our share of responsibility. Ed was the leader I backed him as shadow { chancellor } [ Chancellor ] 100% in the end he didn't persuade people he could  be the { Prime Minister } [ Prime minister ] but I didn't persuade people I could be the { Chancellor } [ Chancellor ]  either. I have to take that on the chin. { People } [ People (magazine) ] will analyse for weeks and months what happened and that's something that still feels too early for { me } [ Me (magazine) ]. That's something I might do in future, might come back to. Not now. It's for others to go for the instant commentary and work out the next steps for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] and the country.NR: You know what they say - were you just  too associated with the past? In  the end is the election that was still about the great crash?  { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ], { Ed Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ], { Gordon Brown } [ Gordon Brown ]  - they're all the lot that got us into the mess.EB: There was a { global } [ World ] { financial crisis } [ Financial crisis ] {. } [ Financial crisis ] I think { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] made important decision during that period to stop { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] & the world going into { depression } [ Depression (mood) ].  But in the end we didn't convince people of that argument and we didn't convince people we were the right people to take the country forward and in the end that's why we lost. And you know the why , the analysis of that is something that will now happen and we can all contribute to that in the future, but for me it feels too early to start making judgements about that. But I know in the end we didn't win because we didn't convince enough people that we were the better alternative for the future and that's our failure.NR: There was one question you know that was asked again and again about the past. Labour spending. But did spending too much mean that you weren't prepared for the after effects of the crash?EB: Before 2007 it is a matter of record that we had a low level of national debt because of the decisions we had made but also we had a small deficit. People will now say that that small deficit should have had a small surplus. The reality is that would have made a small difference, not a big difference, that couldn't have made a difference to the global financial crisis, which was a huge failure in our banking system and a failure of regulation which I have taken on the chin for the last ten years. In the end though we didn't convince people of that argument, but I am afraid those are the facts.NR: So you may have to go back and say 'more spending control might have been better.'?EB: I think it would not have made a difference to the financial crisis at all.NR: But to your credibility? To the sense that people thought you were capable of controlling the public finances?EB: We were very, very disciplined in our approach to public spending after 2010. Unlike other parties we didn't make unfunded commitments.NR: it was before though wasn't it?EB: We had an absolutely disciplined approach in this parliament. before 2007, we had low national debt, we hadn't joined the { euro } [ Euro ], we'd made the bank independent, we had shed a number of jobs in the civil service through the { Gershon Review } [ Gershon Review ], there was a small deficit, people will say there should have been a small surplus, i think that would have made a small difference, not a big difference.NR: There might be some who look at you and say, 'even now, he's not willing to learn.'EB: I think It is for me to think and reflect in the coming months and we can talk about these things, at the moment it is for the leadership candidates in the labour party to set out their positions and it is not really sensible for me to do a running commentary on the past. i always argued for what i thought was right, i have always been consistent, one of things that you learn in politics is that every day when you make a decision, a difficult decision in government or a decision in opposition about what you say, you have at the end of the day to go to bed thinking that was the right call, because you'll live with that for the rest of your life and i have always sought to do that in everything I've done. Are those lessons you want the party to learn?EB: I think I wanted to be more pro business but I also backed { Ed Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ] 100 per cent. He was the leader { I } [ Iain Livingston, Baron Livingston of Wallasey ] was the shadow chancellor { we } [ We (newspaper) ] both worked very hard and in the end neither { he } [ Iain Livingston, Baron Livingston of Wallasey ] or { I } [ Iain Livingston, Baron Livingston of Wallasey ] persuaded people and { we } [ We (newspaper) ] need to take our responsibility for that. It's not all on him it's on all of us.NR: But things like the energy price freeze spooked business didn't they?EB: People are going to stand back and analyse all those things in the months and years to come. I'm not going to rush to judgements. What I'm going to say to you is I accept my responsibility with { Ed } [ Ed Miliband ] and with the whole shadow cabinet for the decisions we took and in the end we didn't convince enough people,NR: you were fighting a { Northern } [ Northern England ] seat against the { Tories } [ Tory ] and against { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ]. you were always one of those who said take the issue of { Europe } [ Europe ] and { immigration } [ Immigration ] seriously - some lessons for the future?EB: I think those were big and important issues and I talked a great deal in my constituency about those matters. And as did { Labour } [ New Zealand Labour Party ] in the run up to the { election } [ 2008 New Zealand general election ], and they're going to be big defining issues of this { Parliament } [ New Zealand Parliament ] as well. In my { constituency } [ Electoral district ] what happened was a collapse in the { Lib Dem } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] vote and more of those voters went to the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] than we were expecting. In the end { Nick Clegg } [ Nick Clegg ] had spent five years in a coalition telling { Lib Dems } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] it was better to be with the { Tories } [ Tory ] and in the end I think you reap what you sow.NR: You'd mentioned the leadership contest - lots of candidates. Presumably you're struggling to think who to support?EB: I'm going to be supporting and voting for { Yvette } [ Yvette Cooper ] of course. I think she's brilliant and people will have a chance to see more of what she is and what she stands for and what she can do in the coming weeks. I'm not going to play any part in her { campaign } [ Political campaign ], that's her { campaign } [ Political campaign ] and her ideas and it's not for me. I've got the opportunity at a time what there's other stuff going on in our lives and for our children, to stand back while she's busy do more for rest of family and that's what I'm going to do but I'll be voting for her like many other { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] members in September.NR: You'll be { cooking } [ Cooking ]?EB: Bit of { cooking } [ Cooking ] of course. A bit of { running } [ Running ] {. } [ Running ] And just making sure.politics is a tough world and families need support and I think one of the things I certainly learnt from my time in Government and when the children were younger you have to try harder to get the balance right. Since 2010 I always made sure I went to parents evening and we went to the school performances and were there to help kids with homework.  I think it's important to get that balance in life.In the end when people's { careers } [ Career ] {. } [ Career ] when something happens you don't expect. I think probably people look back, and too often regret they spent too much time away from things that were important to them and that's something I've been conscious not to let happen in our lives.NR: Given that do you worry for { Yvette } [ Yvette Cooper ]- the woman you love? People say leader of opposition is the worst job in politics and it now lasts 5 years before you have a got at an election - does that worry you?EB: In the end it's really important what happens in the next five years, I want { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] party to come out united and more determined. And I want that to happen. We've learnt some lessons but also we've shown a unity and a vision. We've got a number of great leadership candidates and a really talented shadow cabinet. Having people who can lead and set out a vision is so important, not just for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] but for the country, and I think in politics you have to take your calling when it comes and that's what she's doing.NR: This is the moment for her?EB: Yep.NR: She is not Mrs { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] - she's always been { Yvette Cooper } [ Yvette Cooper ] and I'm sure that's important to you and her. Does that give her the freedom to say the last shadow chancellor didn't quite get that right?EB: Of course and I think over many years she's never been shy of telling me when I got things wrong and me the same with her. She's her own person and has her own talents and her own backers and campaign and her own views and I'm sure she will set them out and she can do that in as forthright a way as she wants and that's fine as far as I'm concerned.NR: When you reflect do you think people have had caricature view of { Ed Balls } [ Ed Balls ] and maybe you'll get the chance to show something a bit different?EB: I think it's really hard in politics for people to see the real you because everything is mediated through the newspaper column and through the prism your opponents can often set up, and in the end  you have to have confidence in yourself and who you are and what your values are and why you do what you do, and you need people to see that and over time I think they do. I've had lots of emails and letters from { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ]  following election night and after my speech to say they were sorry I had lost. In { life } [ Life (magazine) ] I guess you always wish you could make those speeches earlier but that's not the way it is.NR: Is there one lesson in this short fortnight you've already learnt that you think; that's something I now understand for the future?EB: The lesson I've learned are you've always got to be proud of what you've done and enjoy what you're doing rather than fixate on what might be in the future. I've never had a grand plan for my career but nor have I ever felt disappointed that i haven't done something i wanted to do. I've learnt to enjoy what I'm doing and be proud  of what I've done. I think you've also got to make sure in { politics } [ Politics ] you are always thinking about those other sides to your life outside the day to day, and you've always got to know every day that when you make a decision you're doing so for the right reasons and you can that day feel comfortable that in the in months and years to come when people look back and say was that right, that you can be judged knowing with integrity you made the right call and I've always sought to do that.NR: This interview isn't the mark of a return to politics but it isn't the mark of never again, no return to politics?EB: I've been in politics in { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ] and { Westminster } [ Westminster ] for 20 years because I wanted to try and make a difference  to our country and the world. You never say never but for me it's a new chapter, outside of { politics } [ Politics ], but it doesn't mean you stop wanting to make a difference. I always wanted to be in { public service } [ Public service ] that was always more important to me than { wealth } [ Wealth ] or the trappings of { power } [ Power (social and political) ] so who knows? if there's the chance to do something good again that helps people I will take that. But no { by-elections } [ By-election ] {. } [ By-election ] Out of { politics } [ Politics ] {. } [ Out of politics ]  Not back in { parliament } [ Parliament of Australia ] - that's how it feels at the moment.NR: Not back in { parliament } [ Parliament of Singapore ] ever or not till the next election?EB: You never say never.NR: Wait and see?EB: Outside of politics is where I'm going next."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170210005509/http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/news/world-asia-pacific-11811861": "2 April: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] says it will restart its main { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon Nuclear Site ] nuclear complex, including a reactor mothballed in 2007.30 March: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] says it is entering a \"state of war\" with { South Korea } [ South Korea ], amid increasing tension in the peninsula.27 March: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] cuts a key military hotline with { South Korea } [ South Korea ], the last official direct link between the two.19 March: The { US } [ United States ] flies { B-52 } [ Boeing B-52 Stratofortress ] nuclear-capable bombers over { Korean peninsula } [ Korea ], following several { North Korean } [ North Korea ] threats to attack { US } [ United States ] and { South Korean } [ South Korea ] targets.15 March: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] accuses the { US } [ United States ] and its allies of attacks on its internet servers after some of its official websites become inaccessible.11 March: The { US } [ United States ] begins annual joint military drills with { South Korea } [ South Korea ].

The statement is later amended to read that { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] has been \"successfully going forward to reprocess\" the rods.12 April: In a surprise move, { North Korea } [ North Korea ] signals it may be ready to end its insistence on direct talks with the { US } [ United States ], announcing that \"if the { US } [ United States ] is ready to make a bold switchover in its { Korea } [ Korea ] policy for a settlement of the nuclear issue, { North Korea } [ North Korea ] will not stick to any particular dialogue format\".9 April: The { United Nations Security Council } [ United Nations Security Council ] expresses concern about { North Korea } [ North Korea ] {'s } [ North Korea ] nuclear programme, but fails to condemn { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] for pulling out of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.1 April: The { US } [ United States ] announces that \"stealth\" fighters sent to { South Korea } [ South Korea ] for a training exercise are to stay on once the exercises end.10 March: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] fires a second missile into the sea between { South Korea } [ South Korea ] and { Japan } [ Japan ] in as many weeks.2 March: Four { North Korean } [ North Korea ] fighter jets intercept a { US } [ United States ] reconnaissance plane in international air space and shadow it for 22 minutes.25 February: { Roh Moo-hyun } [ Roh Moo-hyun ] sworn in as { South Korean } [ South Korea ] { president } [ President of South Korea ].24 February: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] fires a missile into the sea between { South Korea } [ South Korea ] and { Japan } [ Japan ].12 February: The { IAEA } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] finds { North Korea } [ North Korea ] in breach of nuclear safeguards and refers the matter to the { UN } [ United Nations ] security council.5 February: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] says it has reactivated its nuclear facilities and their operations are now going ahead \"on a normal footing\".31 January: Unnamed { American } [ United States ] officials are quoted as saying that spy satellites have tracked movement at the { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon Station ] plant throughout January, prompting fears that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is trying to reprocess plutonium for nuclear bombs.28 January: In his annual { State of the Union } [ State of the Union ] address, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] says { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is \"an oppressive regime whose people live in fear and starvation\".North Korea says Mr { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ]'s speech is an \"undisguised declaration of aggression to topple the { DPRK } [ North Korea ] system\" and dubs him a \"shameless charlatan\".10 January: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] announces it will withdraw from the { Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty } [ Treaty on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ] {. } [ Nuclear non-Proliferation ]6 January: The { IAEA } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] passes a resolution demanding that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] readmit { UN } [ United Nations ] inspectors and abandon its secret nuclear weapons programme \"within weeks\", or face possible action by the { UN Security Council } [ United Nations Security Council ].27 December: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] says it is expelling two { International Atomic Energy Agency } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] ( {IAEA } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ]) nuclear inspectors from the country. It also says it is planning to reopen a reprocessing plant which could start producing weapons-grade { plutonium } [ Plutonium ] within months.26 December: The { IAEA } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] expresses concern in the light of { UN } [ United Nations ] confirmation that 1,000 fuel rods have been moved to the { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon Nuclear Site ] reactor.25 December: It emerges that { North Korea } [ North Korea ] had begun shipping fuel rods to the { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon Station ] plant which could be used to produce { plutonium } [ Plutonium ].24 December: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] begins repairs at the { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon County ] plant.North-South Korea talks over reopening road and rail border links, which have been struggling on despite the increased tension, finally stall.22 December: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] begins removing monitoring devices from the { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon County ] plant.13 December: { North Korea } [ North Korea ] asks the UN's { IAEA } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] to remove seals and surveillance equipment - the { IAEA } [ International Atomic Energy Agency ]'s \"eyes and ears\" on the North's nuclear status - from its { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon Nuclear Power Plant ] power plant.12 December: The { North } [ North Korea ] threatens to reactivate nuclear facilities for energy generation, saying the { Americans } [ United States ]' decision to halt oil shipments leaves it with no choice.

A key { Korean } [ South Korea ] phrase understood to mean the { North } [ North Korea ] does have nuclear weapons could have been mistaken for the phrase \"entitled to have\", { Seoul } [ Seoul ] says.14 November: { US } [ United States ] President { George W Bush } [ George W. Bush ] declares November oil shipments to the { North } [ North Korea ] will be the last if the { North } [ North Korea ] does not agree to put a halt to its weapons ambitions.20 October: North-South Korea talks in { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] are undermined by the { North } [ North Korea ] {'s } [ North Korea ] nuclear programme \"admission\".US Secretary of State { Colin Powell } [ Colin Powell ] says further US aid to { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is now in doubt.The North adopts a mercurial stance, at one moment defiantly defending its \"right\" to weapons development and at the next offering to halt nuclear programmes in return for aid and the signing of a \"non-aggression\" pact with the { US } [ United States ].It argues that the { US } [ United States ] has not kept to its side of the { Agreed Framework } [ Agreed Framework ], as the construction of the light water reactors - due to be completed in 2003 - is now years behind schedule.18 October: Five { Japanese } [ Japan ] citizens abducted by { North Korea } [ North Korea ] 25 years before are allowed a brief visit home - but end up staying, provoking more tension in the region.17 October: Initially the { North } [ Northern Hemisphere ] appears conciliatory.

Time was passing, and perhaps memories would start to fade.So the question of { parole } [ Parole ] was not an idle enquiry. The { families } [ Family ] of the { children } [ Child ] they killed were becoming anxious about the possibility that one day they might be free to walk the streets again.Myra Hindley had already begun a long and ultimately futile attempt to win her freedom. She tried in vain to persuade a disbelieving world that she had been coerced into the crimes by Brady.The sullen face of the { peroxide } [ Peroxide ] blonde, captured in the famous { police } [ Police ] photograph, continued to stare out from the pages of the { tabloid } [ Tabloid (newspaper format) ] newspapers as each twist of the story was reported.\"She is a good woman,\" { Lord Longford } [ Thomas Corbett, 2nd Baron Longford ] told me more than once, as he tried to advance her case for release. A more unpopular cause to champion, it would be hard to imagine.She was without doubt the most hated woman in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]. Intrigued, I wrote to him and asked him if he was planning to apply for { parole } [ Parole ].I did not expect a reply, so the arrival of a letter from { Gartree Prison } [ HM Prison Gartree ], from prisoner number 605217, came as a shock. As I held it in my hands, unopened, all my memories of the Moors Murders came flooding back.Merely to mention { Brady } [ Brady (film) ] {'s } [ Brady (film) ] name was enough to make anyone alive in the 1960s shudder with horror. He and { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] abducted and killed their young victims and buried four of them on the bleak moors, high above { Manchester } [ Manchester ] {. } [ Manchester ]I began my career as a { journalist } [ Journalist ] in the { North West } [ North West England ] around that time, and needed no reminding of the story.The sight of { police } [ Police ] officers digging, searching for bodies, became an indelible memory for my generation. Along with the smiling faces of the children, captured in family snapshots, and the black and white police photographs of their killers - these images were burned into our minds.Few { crimes } [ Crime ] have caused such revulsion {, } [ Crime in Australia ] or cast such a long shadow {. } [ Crime in Australia ] To many people, { Ian Brady } [ Ian Brady ] was the epitome of { evil } [ Evil ], a sadist who killed without { conscience } [ Conscience ]. If anything, his accomplice Myra Hindley was judged even more harshly, simply because she was a woman.So with all this in my mind, I felt uneasy as I opened the letter. It was short and came straight to the point:\"My position on { parole } [ Parole ] has not altered. I take no part in the annual circus and never shall. It has always been my intention to choose the time and manner of my own death in prison. All I have sought in my twenty years in { prison } [ Prison ] is an active, positive life - unsuccessfully. When members of the parole review committee asked to see him, he said he would not talk to them. Brady thought the process was \"a political farce\", but it showed that { parole } [ Parole ] was indeed a possibility. And that was the end of it. or so I thought. Little did I know that { Brady } [ James Brady (journalist) ] {'s } [ James Brady (journalist) ] brief note was to be the start of a correspondence that was to last more than 30 years.Every few weeks, a new letter would arrive. As the pile grew, they started to give me an insight into the mind of the writer. But ultimately they prompted more questions than answers. From beginning to end, { Ian Brady } [ Ian Brady ] told me only what he wanted me to know.I have often been asked how I could write to such a man. I had vivid memories of the crimes and I suppose I was curious to know more about { Brady } [ Brady Bunch ] and what had driven him to kill.As a { journalist } [ Journalist ], I was able to approach the correspondence with a degree of detachment, but at the same time, I could not forget who he was, or what he had done.I was clear in my own mind that he and { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] should never be released. After { Brady } [ Thomas Brady (banker) ] {'s } [ James Brady ] initial letter {, } [ James Brady ] I assumed the correspondence { would } [ James Brady ] quickly come to an end {. } [ James Brady ]But he continued to write to me from his { prison } [ Prison ] cell, letters that were sometimes written in a shaky hand. He seemed under { stress } [ Stress (biology) ], { mentally } [ Mind ] and { physically } [ Human body ]. Despite being a man who was 6ft (1.83m) tall, his weight had fallen to around 8st (50kg).That year, doctors concluded Brady was mentally ill and he was transferred from { Gartree Prison } [ HM Prison Gartree ] - \"the garbage can\" as he described it - to { Ashworth } [ Ashworth Hospital ] high security hospital on { Merseyside } [ Merseyside ], where he remained until his death.He was soon receiving { drugs } [ Drug ] as part of his treatment, and his { letters } [ Letter (message) ] became more { lucid } [ Lucidity ] and more legible.They ran to many pages, initially on prison { notepaper } [ Notepaper ], then sheets of lined { A4 } [ A4 (paper) ], the kind with very narrow spacing. They were always written with a { ballpoint pen } [ Ballpoint pen ] in a very neat hand, words precisely on the lines, with good { grammar } [ Grammar ] and correct { spelling } [ Spelling ].He did at least have the benefit of going through the { Scottish } [ Scotland ] education system at a time when mastering the three Rs mattered.As I discovered, he was an avid letter-writer, with a wide circle of correspondents, although he wrote to few journalists on a regular basis.I think it helped that I worked for the { BBC } [ BBC ], rather than one of the { tabloid } [ Tabloid (newspaper format) ] newspapers that wrote endless accounts of his life behind bars. Brady catalogued their inventive efforts:\"The national media allege I organised a { Christmas } [ Christmas ] party for the { ward } [ Ward (electoral subdivision) ]. I organised no such party. I ate nothing whatsoever on { Christmas Day } [ Christmas ] {. } [ Christmas ] There was a ward barbecue this afternoon, hordes of strangers waiting to gawp at the performing monkey, but I didn't take the stage. Several national newspapers allege I invited the { Yorkshire } [ Yorkshire ] { Ripper } [ Peter Sutcliffe ], who is even not in this hospital but { Broadmoor } [ Broadmoor Hospital ] {. } [ Broadmoor Hospital ] A { newspaper } [ Newspaper ] falsely states that I go on trips outside. I am in my cell night and day and go nowhere at all.\"Yet for all his hatred of the { media } [ Mass media ], it was clear that he was very aware of his status as a high-profile { prisoner } [ Prisoner ], and I think he enjoyed the notoriety, and being the centre of attention.So while he railed against the stories about him that appeared on a regular basis in the { tabloids } [ Tabloid (newspaper format) ], it became part of his wider battle against all those with power over his life.In writing his letters, he certainly knew that what he said was liable to be reported, and he chose his words carefully, with an eye to publication. His relentless character assassination of { Myra Hindley } [ Myra Hindley ] undoubtedly caused her great damage as she campaigned for { parole } [ Parole ] {. } [ Life imprisonment ]What else did he write about? In large part his letters were a litany of complaints about his treatment at { Ashworth } [ Ashworth, County Durham ] - Trashworth in { Brady } [ Thomas Brady ] {'s } [ Thomas Brady ] lexicon.Writing about life behind bars, he displayed a deep anger, but also an acerbic humour. It was as if he had a special { dictionary } [ Dictionary ] in his head, reserved for pouring scorn on all those in authority whom he hated.I soon got the impression that battling against the { authorities } [ Authority ] - whoever they happened to be - was an important part of his mechanism for coping with his loss of { freedom } [ Freedom ] and { life } [ Life ] within a highly-regulated { institution } [ Institution ].But the letters were more than just the paranoid rantings of a madman. I quickly discovered that he did not fit the popular stereotype of the sub-human monster, an image that most of us recognise instantly from crime thrillers on TV, and find strangely reassuring.We do not expect { serial killers } [ Serial killer ] to live anything approaching normal lives when they are not committing their crimes. They are certainly not supposed to display { intelligence } [ Intelligence ] or { humour } [ Humour ] {. } [ Humour ]So it was more than a little unsettling to discover that Brady was articulate and surprisingly well read, with a preference for classic literature rather than popular fiction.The { Russian } [ Russia ] writer { Dostoevsky } [ Fyodor Dostoevsky ], with his explorations of human { psychology } [ Psychology ], was a particular favourite.Brady's letters were sprinkled with literary references that would send me searching through my bookshelves. His knowledge was nothing if not a testament to the education provided by prison libraries.He made sharp observations about { politics } [ Politics ] and { current affairs } [ Current affairs (news format) ], revealing a close interest in the world outside, a world he knew he would never see again.He had nothing but contempt for the { establishment } [ The Establishment ] in general, and politicians in particular:\"The Gulf - the Bore War. Thirty countries, including the most powerful in the world, against a third world { Arab } [ Arab world ] state, and they call it a victory. Politically, the UK is now to { America } [ United States ] what { Italy } [ Italy ] was to the { Germans } [ Germany ]; a servile lackey willing to bomb any country the { Americans } [ United States ] choose. The { election } [ Election ] {. } [ Election ] a non-event only of synthetic interest to the { media } [ News media ] in generating an appearance of { democracy } [ Democracy ] and choice, between two { Tory } [ Tory ] parties.\"He claimed not to be interested in reading { newspapers } [ Newspaper ], but little that was written about him escaped his notice. He also listened to { radio } [ Radio ] news bulletins, and watched { television } [ Television ]. Several times he told me he had seen me reporting for TV news. Once, I was even talking about him. A lot of the time, he just stayed in his room, read books, and continued his writing. Somewhere, waiting to surface, there is a { memoir } [ Memoir ] of his { life } [ Life (magazine) ] {. } [ Life (magazine) ]He once wrote a book, published in the { US } [ United States ], intended to take the reader inside the mind of a { serial killer } [ Serial killer ] {. } [ Serial killer ] But significantly, it did not include any discussion of his own crimes. And in his letters to me, he was always reluctant to delve too deeply into the past, unless it was to confirm { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] {'s } [ Paul Hindley ] active involvement in the murders.It was as if he was hiding behind a mask that prevented you getting into his head. But there were times when the mask slipped, and you saw something of the { human } [ Human ] being behind the { psychopath } [ Psychopathy ], and hints of an inner turmoil.In 1986, following my correspondence with { Brady } [ Robert Brady ], the mothers of two of his victims wrote to him. His reaction on receiving their letters was revealing:\"Although I've been given them, I've not been able to bring myself to read them yet. I'm afraid to read them, understand? I have to keep the mental blocks tightly shut and keep control.\"The mother of { Lesley Ann Downey } [ Lesley Ann Downey ] wanted to visit him in prison. Her request was refused by the authorities, so Brady suggested I pass on a personal message.I was uncomfortably aware that I was becoming a go-between, a part of the story I was reporting:\"You can inform her of what I've told you. Remorse in this and other matters is axiomatic and painfully deep but I despise useless empty words and prefer positive action to balance part of the past.\"To my knowledge, it was the only time he ever publicly expressed any regret for what he had done.Perhaps, as he suggests, it was just too difficult for him to confront the reality of his crimes. But he seemed to resent being put in a position where he was expected to express remorse. He was not going to jump through any hoops for the press.A small act of contrition, perhaps, but one you may not have read about in the papers.Brady and Hindley belatedly confessed to killing two additional children who disappeared in the 60s, and whose bodies had never been found.In 1987, the two killers were taken back to the moors, separately, to help the { police } [ Police ] to try to find their bodies. Brady found himself back in the { media } [ Mass media ] spotlight. Helicopters and private planes kept circling us and the police seemed determined they would not get any photos. Police kept surrounding me when a low-flying helicopter came at us. Of all hated papers, { the Sun } [ The Sun (United Kingdom) ] got a full-length one, sharp and clear! The moors had changed a lot in my eyes over the 20-odd years that had passed. Many of the changes were real, some imaginary. It was weird seeing the place again, all that space and vastness.\"Eventually, the { police } [ Police ] managed to find the remains of Pauline Reade but, despite many hours of searching, the body of Keith Bennett is still lost on the moors.Was Brady genuine in his desire to help Winnie Johnson find her son? In his letters to me at the time, he seemed anxious for another chance to go back to { Saddleworth } [ Saddleworth ] and complete the search.After a second visit to the moors, in the depths of winter, he insisted that he could have found the boy's grave, given more time:\"The convoy reached the moor around 9am. The { police } [ Police ] let me lead the way and go to any spots I wished. { After } [ After (The Simpsons) ] an hour {, } [ After (The Simpsons) ] I discovered the junction of { streams } [ Stream ] I had been searching for {. } [ After (The Simpsons) ] I felt relief and exhilaration, and we all stopped for another hot drink and a smoke. As daylight began to fade, I felt a deep instinct that I was close to something important, some aspect I had overlooked. I felt a great relief and vindication that I had rectified the crucial mistake. I kept underlining that I know beyond doubt that I've found the area. I'd like to see 40 or 50 { police } [ Police ] searching the area I've pinpointed. I was lying on top of the bed in the dark. An image came into my mind. All along I had been searching purely for a triangular site. But now I was seeing something I had forgotten. I saw { Myra } [ Myra ] walking out of the { triangle } [ Triangle ], but when she reached the apex, she did not climb over it but turned to the right into a curved horn of earth which led upwards. I now have the full image of the site vividly in my head. I do not enjoy struggling through sub-zero wasteland, nor being made a spectacle for the media. The { police } [ Police ] owe me one last visit there. I have nothing to gain except inner peace, for the media will crucify me whether I succeed or fail.\"Keith Bennett's mother, Winnie Johnson, travelled to the moors many times before her death in 2012, enjoying the peace and solitude.I went with her on one occasion. Looking out across the bleak moorland, she told me that to be there made her feel close to her lost son.It was heartbreaking to watch as she waited, year after year, hoping he would be found.But in the end, the details provided by Brady had not been sufficiently precise to locate the burial place.Did he really know? { Winnie Johnson } [ Winnie Johnson ] was convinced that he did. Her lawyers would later go to the { High Court } [ High Court of Justice ] to challenge the power of the { home secretary } [ Home Secretary ] to keep her locked up indefinitely.She did all she could to distance herself from the killings, claiming that she had been forced by { Brady } [ Brady Bunch ] into becoming his accomplice.Few people were convinced. The truth is, she had ample opportunity to go to the { police } [ Police ] and inform on { Brady } [ Tom Brady ] back in the 60s but failed to do so.The case against her was always damning. She drove the car that she and Brady used to abduct children from the streets, and the vehicle was used to transport them to the moors for burial.Even back in the 60s, { children } [ Child ] were warned by their { parents } [ Parent ] not to go off with { strangers } [ Stranger ] {. } [ Stranger ] But the presence of { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] in the car with { Brady } [ Paul Brady ] when they stopped to offer the youngsters a lift must have seemed reassuring. A nice young couple, smiling and joking. Nothing to worry about.Criminologists have always been fascinated by the dynamics of the relationship between { Brady } [ James Brady (motorcyclist) ] and { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ]. If they had not met would the crimes have happened, committed by Brady alone?Some have suggested their relationship was a classic folie a deux, a shared psychosis in which a delusional belief is transferred from one person to another.What is clear is that there was some terrible { chemistry } [ Chemistry ], involving { sex } [ Sex ] and { sadism } [ Sadomasochism ], that made it work.At their { trial } [ Trial ] in 1966, { Brady } [ Robert Brady ] had seemed to be trying to protect { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] from the full weight of the { law } [ Law ]. For several years, they wrote to each other from their { prison } [ Prison ] cells. But the more { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] tried to minimise her role in the killings in an effort to win her freedom, the more resentful he became.He challenged her claim that she had only taken part in the murders because she was afraid of him. His analysis of their partnership was devastating:\" {Myra Hindley } [ Myra Hindley ] and I once loved each other. We were a unified force, not two conflicting entities. The relationship was not based on the delusional concept of folie a deux but on a conscious/subconscious emotional and psychological affinity. She regarded periodic { homicides } [ Homicide ] as rituals of reciprocal innervation, { marriage } [ Marriage ] ceremonies theoretically binding us ever closer. We experimented with the concept of total possibility. Apart, our futures would have taken radically divergent courses.\"For those unfamiliar with ancient history, { Messalina } [ Messalina ] became the most powerful woman in the { Roman Empire } [ Roman Empire ], notorious for her promiscuity, who plotted against her husband, the emperor { Claudius } [ Claudius ] {. } [ Claudius ]By casting { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] in this role, { Brady } [ Robert Brady ] gives a clue to the bitterness he came to feel towards his former lover. He regarded himself and { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] as equal partners in the murders, but she betrayed him and the secret life they had shared.He ridiculed her claims that she was an unwilling accomplice:\" {Hindley } [ John Hindley ] has crafted a { Victorian } [ Victorian era ] melodrama in which she portrays herself as being forced to murder serially. We both habitually carried { revolvers } [ Revolver ] and went for target practice on the { moors } [ Moorland ] {. } [ Moorland ] For 30 years she said she was acting out of love for me; now she maintains she killed because she hated me - a completely irrational hypothesis. In character, she is essentially a { chameleon } [ Chameleon ], adopting whatever { camouflage } [ Camouflage ] will suit and voicing whatever she believes the individual wishes to hear. She can kill, both in cold blood or in a rage.\"Despite my contact with { Brady } [ Robert Brady ], the families of the murdered children always received me with courtesy and kindness. They saw him as a means of keeping { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] behind bars.Like so many others, they could not understand how a woman could have helped to { abduct } [ Child abduction ] and { murder } [ Murder ] children. And in fact, female serial killers are extremely rare.So the { families } [ Family ] of the { children } [ Child ], and the man who killed them, came to form a strange { alliance } [ Military alliance ] {. } [ Alliance ] The families also wanted { Brady } [ Brady (TV series) ]'s help in finding the bodies of the children still missing.I urged him to help the { police } [ Police ] locate the { graves } [ Grave ], to allow the { families } [ Family ] the comfort of a proper { burial } [ Burial ]. The { police } [ Police ] knew { Brady } [ Thomas Brady (author) ] was writing to me but did nothing to hinder the correspondence, perhaps hoping that the letters would reveal useful information.The { detective } [ Detective ] in charge of the case told me: \"He trusts you.\" { Brady } [ Robert Brady ] himself said he appreciated reporting that was \"balanced and unsensational\", although I must admit it was sometimes difficult to remain dispassionate.At around the time he was being taken back to the moors by the { police } [ Police ], Brady told me that he was responsible for another five murders, or \"happenings\" as he called them. With only sketchy details to go on, they were unable to confirm his claims. Did they really happen? Or were they just part of his { fantasy } [ Fantasy ] world? It was yet another part of the story where the truth would never be known.The trips back to the moors were the only break from the monotony of { Brady } [ Tom Brady ]'s daily life in { Ashworth Hospital } [ Ashworth Hospital ] {. } [ Ashworth Hospital ] But there was always something for him to complain about. In 1999, when he was moved to a new { ward } [ Ward (electoral subdivision) ], he went on { hunger strike } [ Hunger strike ] {. } [ Hunger strike ]He recounted his daily existence:\"I've sat in my room, going nowhere, never having exercised in the open air for 25 years, using every available \"normal channel\" to right matters here these past 15 years, and throughout my 35 years of captivity. I have no { TV } [ Television ] or { radio } [ Radio ] and don't read { newspapers } [ Newspaper ], though I've been told of some reports. I simply sit { writing } [ Writing ] or { reading } [ Reading ] { books } [ Book ] most of the time. So he went to { court } [ Court ], hoping to establish a legal right to end his life.In 2000, a { hearing } [ Hearing (law) ] was held in { Liverpool } [ Liverpool ], behind closed doors. The tight { security } [ Security ] meant that the waiting { media } [ Mass media ] did not even get a glimpse of him as he enjoyed his day in { court } [ Court ]. But he got his story out.Knowing the { hearing } [ Hearing (law) ] would be held in private {, } [ William Hunter (banker) ] he had sent { me } [ William Hunter (banker) ] a 5,000-word document {, } [ William Hunter (banker) ] setting out his case {. } [ William Hunter (banker) ]Once again, { Brady } [ Brad Brady ] was the centre of attention, taking on the system. But his arguments failed to convince the { judge } [ Judge ], and the { hospital } [ Hospital ] was told it could continue to feed him, to keep him alive.Then in { 2013 } [ 2013 NFL season ] {, } [ 2013 NFL season ] Brady finally got the public platform he craved. The media were able to observe him via a { television } [ Television ] relay as he gave evidence to a { mental health } [ Mental health ] { tribunal } [ Tribunal ] at { Ashworth } [ Ashworth ].The picture that emerged was of a man who was { paranoid } [ Paranoia ] and { narcissistic } [ Narcissism ] {. } [ Narcissism ] He wanted to be sent back to { prison } [ Prison ], where he might have been able to complete his { hunger strike } [ Hunger strike ] without { medical } [ Medicine ] intervention.Brady seemed to relish the occasion. He was back in the spotlight, back in the headlines. But once again the decision went against him.During the hearing {, } [ List of people from New York City ] Brady refused to answer a direct question about whether he would in fact kill himself if was sent back to prison.In his letters to me, however, he said his life had become meaningless and all he wanted was the opportunity to bring it to an end:\"I have had enough. My objective is to die and release myself from this once and for all. I am not interested in being kept alive artificially by force feeding. My death strike is { rational } [ Rationality ] and { pragmatic } [ Pragmatism ] {. } [ Pragmatism ] I am eager to leave this cesspit in a coffin. He found it difficult being surrounded by other patients who were all mentally ill, rather than being able to mix with the diverse characters he had encountered in the penal system:\"In prison I had intelligent company - train robbers, { IRA } [ Provisional Irish Republican Army ] and { Arab } [ Arab world ] terrorists, financiers, counterfeiters, gun-runners, drug lords, { East End } [ East End of London ] gangsters, ex-government ministers. I played { John Stonehouse } [ John Stonehouse ] in the { chess } [ Chess ] final at { Wormwood Scrubs } [ Wormwood Scrubs ] {. } [ Wormwood Scrubs ] Having spent the past years in the company of { criminals } [ Crime ] and madmen, I have a very unusual circle of friends out there in the free world.\"Did { Brady } [ Brady Burch ] ever look back over his life and contemplate how things might have been different?A few years ago, he let me see a letter he had written to his mother. To my surprise, it was a wistful { memoir } [ Memoir ] of the happy times they had spent together in his youth.It described in lyrical terms holidays spent in the { Scottish Highlands } [ Scottish Highlands ], the sentiments quite at odds with his reputation as a tough kid from the { Gorbals } [ Gorbals ]:\"When I close my eyes, I re-live childhood holidays in fascinating detail, many forgotten memories surfacing. Remember the low ceilings and oil lamps in the whitewashed Dunning cottage and the late-night cups of { Oxo } [ Oxo (drink) ]? The honking geese in the courtyard of the farm we stayed at in { Tobermory } [ Tobermory, Perth and Kinross ]? The red deer standing in the deep green gloom of the deciduous forest; the wildcat I surprised in the high heather hills behind the farm; the wooden bridge in the meadow beside the farm? Naturally I also bring to mind all the other holidays. enough. After giving us a tantalising glimpse of happy days during his childhood, he firmly closes the door to the past. He ends the letter with a request to his mother to send me a copy.She was then aged about 90 and living in relative anonymity in { Longsight } [ Longsight ], near the centre of { Manchester } [ Manchester ] {. } [ Manchester ] Surprisingly, perhaps, she never moved away from the city where her son committed his dreadful crimes.This unexpected glimpse into their life together was startling. Stories about Brady's childhood had painted a picture of a troubled boy who had grown up in a { single-parent } [ Single parent ] home, never knowing his real father.As Brady acknowledged himself, the reality of his childhood years seemed to contradict a widely-held view about the roots of violent crime, especially sexual crime:\"It is fashionable nowadays to blame one's faults on abuse as a child. I had a happy childhood.\"Why had { Brady } [ Brady Bunch ] wanted me to see the letter to his mother? Was he trying to show he was a man with human emotions like everyone else? It inevitably prompts the question of how someone capable of such feelings could become a cold-blooded predator who enticed children away from their homes and families, and then killed them with his bare hands.The happy childhood did not last. It appeared to offer reasonable prospects, and perhaps the hope of a decent life. But fate took a hand.Working in the same { office } [ Office ] was a young { typist } [ Typing ] called Myra Hindley. We will never know if things might have been different had they not met, but together they were deadly.Perhaps it was memories of his { childhood } [ Childhood ] holidays that drew him to the bleak { moorland } [ Moorland ] above { Manchester } [ Manchester ] {. } [ Manchester ] Just as the { Scottish Highlands } [ Scottish Highlands ] may have been a welcome relief from the tenements of { Glasgow } [ Glasgow ], so the empty landscape of { Saddleworth } [ Saddleworth ] may have offered an escape from the terraced houses and factories of industrial { Manchester } [ Manchester ].Judging by the snapshots { Brady } [ Brady (album) ] took of himself and { Hindley } [ Hindley (band) ] on the moors, it was somewhere that he felt happy.But it was also a place made special by the terrible secrets it held, secrets that bound the two of them together. Until you realise that they include a shot of { Hindley } [ Paul Hindley ] standing on the grave of one of their victims.This was the woman who would later claim that she was { Brady } [ Tom Brady ]'s unwilling accomplice. The photographs, and a horrific { tape recording } [ Tape recording ] of their victim Lesley Ann Downey, tell a different story.Given his love of open spaces, how much of a punishment was it for Brady to be confined within the walls of a { prison } [ Prison ] or a high security { hospital } [ Hospital ] for so many years?At { Ashworth } [ Ashworth Prison ], he refused his right to take exercise in the open air for many years. Another contradiction.Our lengthy correspondence has finally been ended by his death. It is easy to dismiss { Brady } [ Brady Bunch ] as an { evil } [ Evil ] monster, who does not deserve an ounce of { pity } [ Pity ].I have met the families of the children he killed, and seen how he shattered so many lives. They spent years living with the consequences of his crimes. As the mother of { Lesley Ann Downey } [ Lesley Ann Downey ] once told me, the families are the ones serving a life sentence.For nearly 50 years, { Brady } [ Tom Brady ] tormented them. His own life was effectively over when he was convicted at the age of just 28.It was only the abolition of the { death penalty } [ Capital punishment ] just before his { trial } [ Trial ] that saved him from the { hangman's } [ Hanging ] noose. He survived, but it turned out to be a living death.I am left with a box full of letters, but I am still little the wiser about what drove him to kill.Ian Brady has finally gone to his grave, having found the death he craved for so long. Many of his secrets have gone with him. He remains the { personification } [ Personification ] of dark forces that we struggle to understand."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170428055840/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34496764": "Each qualified nation were assigned to one of four pots for the draw according to their { Uefa } [ UEFA ] coefficient ranking, which is based on all competitive results since September 2010.Which of the finalists is \"practically the finished article\", and which is \"as interesting as an early morning trip to { Ikea } [ Ikea ] {\"?Euro 2016 } [ Euro 2016 ] prospects: { France } [ France national football team ] were the last host nation to win the title, in { 1984 } [ Eurovision Song Contest 1984 ], and are among the favourites this time.

Martin O'Neill has dovetailed effectively with assistant { Roy Keane } [ Roy Keane ], gradually reviving { Irish } [ Republic of Ireland ] fortunes after things turned sour in { Giovanni Trapattoni } [ Giovanni Trapattoni ]'s final two years.Euro 2016 prospects: Few teams will go into the { Euros } [ UEFA Euro 2016 ] as reliant on one player as { Sweden } [ Sweden national football team ] are. { Zlatan Ibrahimovic } [ Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 ], \"the only world-class player we have\" according to coach { Erik Hamren } [ Erik Hamren ], is { captain } [ Captain (association football) ], talisman and national icon.They have an experienced squad, but one that lacks a bit of spark. As a { Danish } [ Denmark ] tabloid cattily put it, Ibrahimovic aside, { Sweden } [ Sweden ]'s team is \"about as interesting as an early morning trip to { Ikea } [ Ikea ] {\". } [ Ikea ]How they qualified: Pipped by { Russia } [ Russia national football team ] to the second qualifying spot in { Group G } [ 1998 FIFA World Cup Group G ], they met neighbours { Denmark } [ Denmark national football team ] in the play-offs and won 4-3 on aggregate thanks to { Ibrahimovic } [ Yassine Ibrahimovic ]'s brilliance.Euro pedigree: This is their fifth successive appearance at a { Euros } [ UEFA European Championship ], and sixth in total. Their best performance came on debut in { 1992 } [ 1992 AFC Asian Cup ] {, } [ 1992 AFC Asian Cup ] when they made the semi-finals as hosts.Key player: No surprise here, it's Ibrahimovic.

After { Austria } [ Austria national football team ] booked their place in { France } [ France ] with victory against { Sweden } [ Sweden national football team ], he turned up to the post-match media conference wearing a { beret } [ Beret ] and eating a baguette.Euro 2016 prospects: { Hungary } [ Hungary ] ended a 30-year championship drought with qualification. Not a single member of their squad plays regularly in any of { Europe } [ Europe ] {'s } [ Spain ] top five leagues and they would appear to be among the weakest sides heading to { France } [ France ] {. } [ France ]How they qualified: They won just four of their 10 group games and went through three different coaches, but ultimately saw off { Norway } [ Norway national football team ] in the play-offs.Euro pedigree: They were heavyweights in the competition's early tournaments, finishing third in { 1964 } [ 1964 European Nations' Cup ] and fourth in { 1972 } [ 1972 European Nations' Cup ] {. } [ UEFA Euro 1972 ] They subsequently failed to qualify for 10 successive finals until now.Key player: { Balazs Dzsudzsak } [ Balazs Dzsudzsak ] {. } [ Balazs Dzsudzsak ] The 28-year-old left { winger } [ Midfielder ] and { captain } [ Captain (association football) ] was crucial to their qualification.

Stability could be restored, { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] interests and citizens in { Iran } [ Iran ] would be protected.At the time, the { Iranian } [ Iran ] scene was chaotic. Protesters clashed with troops, shops were closed, public services suspended. Meanwhile, labour strikes had all but halted the flow of { oil } [ Oil ], jeopardising a vital { Western } [ Western world ] interest.Khomeini feared the nervous military: its { royalist } [ Royalist ] { top brass } [ Military brass ] hated him. Even more worrying, they were having daily meetings with a { US Air Force } [ United States Air Force ] General by the name of Robert E Huyser, whom President { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] had sent on a mysterious mission to { Tehran } [ Tehran ].The { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] was determined to return to { Iran } [ Iran ] after 15 years in exile and make the { Shah } [ Shah ] {'s } [ Shah ] \"vacation\" permanent. So he made a personal appeal.In a first-person message, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] told the { White House } [ White House ] not to panic at the prospect of losing a strategic ally of 37 years and assured them that he, too, would be a friend.\"You will see we are not in any particular animosity with the { Americans } [ United States ] {,\" said Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ], pledging his { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ] will be \"a humanitarian one, which will benefit the cause of peace and tranquillity for all mankind\".Khomeini's message is part of a trove of newly declassified { US } [ United States ] government documents - diplomatic cables, policy memos, meeting records - that tell the largely unknown story of { America } [ United States ]'s secret engagement with Khomeini, an enigmatic cleric who would soon inspire { Islamic fundamentalism } [ Islamic fundamentalism ] and { anti-Americanism } [ Anti-Americanism ] worldwide.This story is a detailed account of how { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] brokered his return to { Iran } [ Iran ] using a tone of deference and amenability towards the { US } [ United States ] that has never before been revealed.The ayatollah's message was, in fact, the culmination of two weeks of direct talks between his de facto chief of staff and a representative of the US government in { France } [ France ] - a quiet process that helped pave the way for { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s safe return to { Iran } [ Iran ] and rapid rise to power - and decades of high-stakes tension between { Iran } [ Iran ] and { America } [ United States ].In the official { Iranian } [ Iran ] narrative of the revolution, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] bravely defied the { United States } [ United States ] and defeated \"the Great Satan\" in its desperate efforts to keep the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] in power.But the documents reveal that { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] was far more engaged with the { US } [ United States ] than either { government } [ Government ] has ever admitted. Far from defying { America } [ United States ], the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] courted the { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] administration, sending quiet signals that he wanted a dialogue and then portraying a potential { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ] as amenable to { US } [ United States ] interests.To this day, former { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] administration officials maintain that { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] - despite being sharply divided over the course of action - stood firm behind the { Shah } [ Shah ] and his government.But the documents show more nuanced { US } [ United States ] behaviour behind the scenes. Only two days after the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] departed { Tehran } [ Tehran ], the { US } [ United States ] told a { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] envoy that they were - in principle - open to the idea of changing the { Iranian } [ Iran ] constitution, effectively abolishing the monarchy.

Immediately, three days of violent protests broke out, which the military put down swiftly.A recently declassified { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] document reveals that, in November 1963, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] sent a rare message of support to the { Kennedy } [ John F.

So close to victory, the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] still needed { America } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ]Ayatollah { Ruhollah Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] - { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] Muslim religious leader, living in exile in { Paris } [ Paris ] in early 1979Ayatollah { Mohammad Beheshti } [ Mohammad Beheshti ] - { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s second-in-command in { Iran } [ Iran ], a { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] cleric seen by the US as a pragmatist {Ebrahim Yazdi } [ Ebrahim Yazdi ] - { Iranian-American } [ Iranian Americans ] physician living in { Houston } [ Houston ], { Texas } [ Texas ], who became a spokesman and advisor to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi } [ Reza Shah ] - the last king of { Iran } [ Iran ], formerly backed by the US governmentShapour Bakhtiar - the { Shah } [ Reza Shah ]'s last prime minister {William Sullivan } [ William Sullivan (diplomat) ] - the US ambassador to { Iran } [ Iran ] {Cyrus Vance } [ Cyrus Vance ] - US Secretary of State {Warren Zimmermann } [ Warren Zimmermann ] - a political counsellor with the US embassy in { France } [ France ], used as a messenger for the US to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {Robert E Huyser } [ Robert E. Huyser ] - an { US Air Force } [ United States Air Force ] general sent by { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] on a secretive mission to { Tehran } [ Tehran ] in January 1979By January 1979, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] had the momentum, but he also deeply feared a last-minute { American } [ United States ] intervention - a repetition of the 1953 coup, when the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] had helped put the { Shah } [ Reza Shah ] back in power.The situation became explosive after the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s new prime minister, { Shapour Bakhtiar } [ Shapour Bakhtiar ], deployed troops and tanks to close the airport, disrupting { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s planned return in late January.It seemed { Iran } [ Iran ] was on the brink of a civil war: the elite { Imperial Guard } [ Imperial Guard (Iran) ] divisions were ready to fight to the death for their king; the die-hard followers of the { Imam } [ Imam ] were ready for armed struggle and martyrdom.The { White House } [ White House ] feared an { Iranian } [ Iran ] civil war that would have major implications for { US } [ United States ] strategic interests. At stake were the lives of thousands of US military advisors; the security of sophisticated { American } [ United States ] weapons systems in { Iran } [ Iran ], such as { F-14 } [ McDonnell Douglas F-14 Tomcat ] jets; a vital flow of oil; and the future of the most important institution of power in { Iran } [ Iran ], the military.It was less alarmed by the rise of { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {, } [ Tehran ] and the downfall of the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] {. } [ Tehran ]But { President } [ President of Iran ] { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] had previously rejected a proposal to cut a deal between { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] and the { military } [ Islamic Republic of Iran Army ].On 9 November 1978, in a now-famous cable, \"Thinking the Unthinkable,\" the US ambassador to { Iran } [ Iran ] {, William Sullivan } [ William J. Sullivan ], warned that the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] was doomed. He argued that { Washington } [ United States ] should get the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] and his top generals out of { Iran } [ Iran ], and then make a deal between junior commanders and { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ].Sullivan's bold proposal caught { President } [ President of the United States ] { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] off-guard, and caused their relationship to go sour.But by early January, the reluctant { president } [ President of Iran ] concluded that the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] {'s } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] departure was necessary to calm the { opposition } [ Iranian opposition ].Amid reports of an impending military coup {, } [ President of Argentina ] the { president } [ President of Argentina ] summoned his top advisors on 3 January.\"A genuinely non-aligned { Iran } [ Iran ] need not be viewed as a { US } [ United States ] setback,\" the { president } [ President of the United States ] said, according to minutes of the meeting.That day, { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] dispatched General { Robert E Huyser } [ Robert E. Huyser ], Deputy Commander of US Forces in { Europe } [ Europe ], to { Tehran } [ Tehran ] to tell the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s generals to sit tight and \"not jump into a coup\" against Prime Minister { Bakhtiar } [ Mohammad Bakhtiar ].But { Bakhtiar } [ Mohammad Bakhtiar ] had no real support among the opposition, who called him the { Shah } [ Shah ] {'s } [ Iran ] agent {. } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]Sullivan praised { Bakhtiar } [ James Bakhtiar ] {'s } [ James Bakhtiar ] courage to his face, but behind his back, told { Washington } [ George Washington ] that the man was \"quixotic\", playing for high stakes, and would not take \"guidance\" from the { US } [ United States ].The { state } [ States of Australia ] department saw his { government } [ Government ] as \"not viable\". The { White House } [ White House ] strongly backed him in public, but in private, explored ousting him in a { coup } [ Coup d'\u00e9tat ].\"The best that can result, in my view, is a military coup against { Bakhtiar } [ Mohammad Bakhtiar ] and then a deal struck between the military and { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] that finally pushes the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] out of power,\" wrote Deputy National Security Advisor { David Aaron } [ David Aaron ] to his boss { Zbigniew Brzezinski } [ Zbigniew Brzezinski ] on 9 January 1979.\"Conceivably this deal could be struck without the { military } [ Military ] acting against { Bakhtiar } [ Mohammad Bakhtiar ] first,\" he added.Two days later, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] finally told the depressed and cancer-stricken { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] to \"leave promptly\".By then, a broad consensus had emerged within the { US } [ United States ] national security bureaucracy that they could do business with the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] and his inner circle after all. It is not true that we wouldn't sell to the { US } [ United States ] {,\" Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] told an { American } [ United States ] visitor in { France } [ France ] on 5 January, urging him to convey his message to { Washington } [ George Washington ]. The visitor did, sharing the notes of the conversation with the { US } [ United States ] embassy.In a key meeting at the { White House } [ White House ] { Situation Room } [ Situation Room ] on 11 January, the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] predicted that { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] would sit back and let his moderate, Western-educated followers and his second-in-command, Ayatollah { Mohammad Beheshti } [ Mohammad Beheshti ], run the government.Beheshti was considered by { US } [ United States ] officials to be a rare bird: a pragmatic, { English-speaking } [ English language ] cleric with a university education, experience of living in the { West } [ Western world ], and close ties to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]. In short, he was someone with whom the { Americans } [ United States ] could reason.\"We would do a disservice to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] to consider him simply as a symbol of segregated education and an opponent to women's rights,\" said the then-head of the { State Department } [ United States Department of State ] { Intelligence Bureau } [ Intelligence Bureau (United States) ], { Philip Stoddard } [ Philip Stoddard ]. { Huyser } [ Mohammad-Taqi Huyser ] was good at following orders, and had the confidence of the { Iranian } [ Iran ] military leaders. The { US } [ United States ] believed such a meeting would lead to a military \"accommodation\" with { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {. } [ Iran ]To help break the stalemate {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] President { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] swallowed his own prestige {. } [ Washington, D.C. ] On the evening of 14 January, US Secretary of State { Cyrus Vance } [ Cyrus Vance ] sent a cable to US embassies in { Paris } [ Paris ] and { Tehran } [ Tehran ]: \"We have decided that it is desirable to establish a direct { American } [ United States ] channel to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s entourage.\"Around noon on 15 January, political counsellor { Warren Zimmermann } [ Warren Zimmermann ] of the { US } [ United States ] embassy in { France } [ France ] arrived at a quiet inn at the small town of { Neauphle-le-Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau } [ Neauphle-le-Ch\u00e2teau ], outside { Paris } [ Paris ], where { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] lived. Zimmermann had borrowed his boss's private { Peugeot } [ Peugeot ], which didn't have diplomatic plates, to avoid being tracked.\"I go in and there was this large dining room empty except for this one guy sitting at a table, and that was Yazdi,\" recalled { Zimmermann } [ Zimmermann (book) ] years later in his oral history.This was { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s de facto chief of staff, { Ebrahim Yazdi } [ Ebrahim Yazdi ], an { Iranian-American } [ Iranian Americans ] physician.A resident of { Houston } [ Houston ], { Texas } [ Texas ], Yazdi had already established ties with US officials in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] through a former { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] operative who had turned into a liberal, anti-Shah scholar, { Richard Cottam } [ Richard Cottam ].Establishing a direct link with { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] was a highly sensitive matter; if revealed, it would be interpreted as a shift in { US } [ United States ] policy, a clear signal to the entire world that { Washington } [ United States ] was dumping its old friend, the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ].1953: { Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] (the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]) is restored to power after a US and British-backed coup overthrows the prime minister of { Iran } [ Iran ]1963: Ayatollah { Ruhollah Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] rises to prominence for denouncing the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]1964: { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] is arrested and expelled from { Iran } [ Iran ]. { He } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] spends the next 15 years in Turkey and Iraq preaching against the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]15 January1979: { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] enters into a two-week dialogue from exile in { France } [ France ] with the { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] administration16 January 1979: The { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] flees { Iran } [ Iran ] as the country inches towards civil war1 February 1979: { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] returns to { Tehran } [ Tehran ], where millions line the streets to welcome him as the leader of the { Iranian } [ Iran ] revolutionEarlier in the day, Secretary { Vance } [ John C. Vance ] informed the { French } [ France ] government that { Washington } [ United States ] urgently needed to be in direct contact with { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s group.Beheshti had met { Sullivan } [ John C. Sullivan ], but out of security concerns, refused to meet with the { Iranian } [ Iran ] generals.A second meeting was quickly scheduled, and { Zimmermann } [ J\u00fcrgen Zimmermann ] was told to pass along that the military had seriously discussed a coup plan upon the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s departure, but General { Huyser } [ George Huyser ] talked them out of it. The army would \"remain calm during that period, provided troops are not provoked,\" a { cable } [ Diplomatic cable ] from the { US } [ United States ] { embassy } [ Diplomatic mission ] in { Tehran } [ Tehran ] said.On 17 January, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] wrote in his diary that he was pushing hard to keep { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] out of { Iran } [ Iran ]. But the next day, his { administration } [ Government of Iran ] told { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] that it had no problem with his \"orderly\" homecoming.The { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] administration began secret talks with { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] with the primary objective of making an elusive deal between the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] and the military. It's also possible that they wanted to slow down { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s momentum or read his intentions. But they ended up achieving none of those goals.Khomeini wanted a decisive victory, not a deal. But a tactical engagement with { Washington } [ George Washington ] suited him well. { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ], in fact, had a set of key questions to determine { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ]'s commitment to the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s regime and the orientation of the { Iranian } [ Iran ] military.The { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] didn't have to try very hard. { America } [ United States ] would easily reveal its hand.By the third time { Zimmermann } [ Zimmermann (film) ] and { Yazdi } [ Yazdi (film) ] met, they had good news for each other. It was the morning of 18 January 1979. The venue: the same quiet inn near { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {'s } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] compound outside { Paris } [ Paris ] {. } [ Paris ]Khomeini had authorized { Beheshti } [ Nasrallah Beheshti ] to meet with the generals, { Yazdi } [ Saeed Yazdi ] confirmed. And { Zimmermann } [ Zimmermann ] had an important clarification for the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] {. } [ Imam ]During their second meeting, { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] had warned { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] that his \"sudden return\" would lead to a disaster, as the { Iranian } [ Iran ] military might react \"to protect the constitution\" which stated in no uncertain terms that the constitutional monarchy was \"unchangeable for eternity\".Put frankly, did the { US } [ United States ] think the { Iranian } [ Iran ] military had given up on the { Pahlavi } [ Pahlavi dynasty ] regime and was \"willing to work within the framework of a new democratic republic\"?It took two days for { Washington } [ United States ] to clarify. The answer, which was kept secret for 35 years, made clear to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] that { America } [ United States ] was \"flexible\" about the { Iranian } [ Iran ] political system.Like most official statements {, } [ List of Latin phrases (L) ] it began with generalities. The main point was put at the end.\"We do not say that the { constitution } [ Constitution ] cannot be changed, but we do believe that the established, orderly procedures for making changes should be followed.\"If the integrity of the army can be preserved, we believe there is every prospect the leadership will support whatever political form is selected for { Iran } [ Iran ] in the future.\"In other words, { Washington } [ George Washington ], in principle, was open to the idea of abolishing the monarchy, and the { Shah } [ Shah ] {'s } [ Shah ] military, whose top brass met daily with General { Huyser } [ George Huyser ], would be willing to accept such an outcome provided the process was gradual and controlled. Instead, he had just received a clear signal that the { US } [ United States ] considered the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] finished, and in fact was looking for a face-saving way to protect the military and avoid a { communist } [ Communism ] takeover.As usual, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {'s } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] chief of staff \"took copious notes\" in { Persian } [ Persian language ] to be delivered to the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] {. } [ Ayatollah ]The { American } [ United States ] { diplomat } [ Diplomat ] wanted to make sure that the { Iranian } [ Iran ] envoy understood what exactly the message entailed.\"While Zimmermann did cite the points on the constitution in the paragraph, he called { Yazdi } [ Nasser Yazdi ]'s primary attention to the last two sentences of it, which hopefully conveyed to { Yazdi } [ Nasser Yazdi ] a sense of { US } [ United States ] flexibility on the constitution,\" said the { US } [ United States ] ambassador in { France } [ France ] to { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] in a separate cable.The { US } [ United States ] had effectively told { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] that the military had lost its nerve. \"These officers fear the unknown; they fear an uncharted future,\" { Zimmermann } [ Zimmermann (film) ] told { Yazdi } [ Yazdi ] during the same meeting.To { Washington } [ George Washington ] {'s } [ George Washington ] relief, the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] pledged not to destroy the military {. } [ George Washington ] His emissary urged { America } [ United States ] not to pull its sophisticated weapons systems out of { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ]Yazdi also clarified an { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ] would make a distinction between { Israel } [ Israel ] and its own { Jewish } [ Jews ] residents - which had begun fleeing { Iran } [ Iran ] in droves.\"You can tell the { American } [ United States ] { Jews } [ Jews ] not to worry about the { Jewish } [ Jews ] future in { Iran } [ Iran ] {,\" he said. } [ Iran ]Khomeini and { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] both wished to avoid a violent clash between the { military } [ Military ] and the { opposition } [ Opposition (politics) ]. But their aims were fundamentally different.Carter wanted to preserve the { military } [ Military ] - which { Sullivan } [ James Sullivan (general) ] once described as an unpredictable \"wounded animal\" - in order to use it as powerful leverage in the future.But { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] wanted to trap the beast and finish it. The { military } [ Armed Forces of the Republic of the Congo ] was a long-term threat to his { regime } [ Regime ] {. } [ Regime ] Its { decapitation } [ Decapitation ] and destruction was a top priority.Washington had answered { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {'s } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] questions about the future of the { monarchy } [ Monarchy ] and the orientation of the { military } [ Military ]. Now, it was the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ]'s turn. The { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] administration wanted to know about the future of US core interests in { Iran } [ Iran ]: { American } [ United States ] investments, oil flow, political-military relations, and views on the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ].It was an artfully-crafted portrait of an { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ], mirroring what Carter had sketched at a conference of world leaders on { Guadeloupe Island } [ Guadeloupe ] earlier that month: an { Iran } [ Iran ] free of { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] domination, neutral, if not friendly to { America } [ United States ], one that would not export revolution, or cut oil flow to the { West } [ Western world ].\"We will sell our { oil } [ Oil ] to whoever purchases it at a just price,\" { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] wrote.\"The oil flow will continue after the establishment of the { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ], except for two countries: { South Africa } [ South Africa ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] {,\" he added } [ Israel ] {. } [ Israel ]As for foreign investments {, } [ United States ] the { US } [ United States ] was likely to have a role {. } [ United States ] He implied that the { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ] would be interested in buying { tractors } [ Tractor ], not { tanks } [ Tank ], making it also clear that he had no \"particular affinity\" for the { Russians } [ Russia ].\"The { Russian } [ Russia ] government is { atheistic } [ Atheism ] and { anti-religion } [ Antireligion ] {. } [ Religion ] { We } [ United States ] will definitely find it more difficult to have a deep understanding with the { Russians } [ Russia ] {,\" Yazdi } [ Yazdi (TV series) ] added to { Zimmermann } [ Zimmermann (TV series) ] as he delivered the answers.\"You are { Christians } [ Christians ] and believe in { God } [ God ] and they don't. { We } [ United States ] feel it easier to be closer to you than to { Russians } [ Russia ] {,\" } [ Russia ] Yazdi { said } [ Russia ] {. } [ Russia ]Khomeini also vowed not to destabilise the region.\"Non-interference in other people's affairs\", he wrote, would be the policy of the future government.The { Islamic Republic } [ Islamic republic ], unlike the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s regime, would not act as the policeman of the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ], but it would not get into the business of exporting the revolution either.\"We will not ask the people of { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Kuwait } [ Kuwait ], or { Iraq } [ Iraq ] to kick the foreigners out,\" { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] wrote.The chaos in { Iran } [ Iran ] had alarmed most of { Iran } [ Iran ]'s { Arab } [ Arab world ] neighbours, who feared that after the { Shah } [ Shah ]'s downfall armed { Marxist } [ Marxism ] groups would take over. A { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] assessment concluded { Arab } [ Arab world ] conservatives found it hard to believe { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] or a regime associated with his ideas could be a lasting government in { Iran } [ Iran ].But the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] would soon eliminate all the { Marxist } [ Marxism ] groups that had supported his struggle. Before liquidating the left, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] and his radical followers would push out the moderates, including { Yazdi } [ Rafic Yazdi ], on the grounds that they were pro- {American } [ United States ] and not real revolutionaries.On 24 January, key members of the secret { Islamic Revolutionary Council } [ Islamic Revolutionary Council ], including a cleric by the name of Ayatollah Mousavi Ardebili - the future Chief Justice of the Islamic Republic who would play a major role in the executions of thousands of political opponents - met with the US ambassador, { William Sullivan } [ William J. Sullivan ].The { cleric } [ Clergy ] seemed reasonable. He was a more forceful type, reported { Sullivan } [ John C. Sullivan ] to { Washington } [ George Washington ], but \"no fanatic\".Three days later, { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] himself made a direct appeal to the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ White House ]Khomeini, in effect, had three requests: smooth the way for his return, press the constitutional government to resign, and force the military to capitulate.The { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] also included a subtle warning that if the army cracked down, his followers would direct their violence against { US } [ United States ] citizens in { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ]Still, he made sure to end on a positive note, emphasising the urgent need for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.Cabled from the { US } [ United States ] embassy in { France } [ France ] after being delivered by Yazdi, the message reached the highest levels of the { US } [ United States ] government.In a phone conversation on 27 January, Defence Secretary { Harold Brown } [ Harold Brown (British Army officer) ] told General { Huyser } [ George Huyser ] about { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s secret message and his discussion with President { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] about it. Brown made it clear to Huyser that { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {'s } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] return was a \"tactical\" matter that had to be left to the { Iranian } [ Iran ] authorities.The administration was pleased that the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] had agreed to direct methods of communication and wished to continue the talks, according to the newly declassified version of { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {'s } [ United States ] draft response to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ].The proposed response warned { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] against setting up his own government, stressing the crisis should be resolved through dialogue with the { Iranian } [ Iran ] authorities.The text was sent to the { US } [ United States ] embassy in { Tehran } [ Tehran ] for feedback, where it ended up on the shelf, never making it to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] in { France } [ France ].But it didn't matter. Soon, the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ] would be on his way back to { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ]Washington had already tacitly agreed to a key part of { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s requests by telling the military leaders to stay put. General { Huyser } [ Mohammad-Reza Huyser ] had told the military that { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {'s } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] return alone did not itself constitute a sufficient cause for implementing \"Option C\", a direct reference to the { coup } [ Coup d'\u00e9tat ] option.\"This might make him more reasonable or at least less involved in political affairs,\" he told the { American } [ United States ] ambassador, two weeks before being swept away by the { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] wave.Two days before the { ayatollah } [ Ayatollah ]'s arrival, the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s top commander had given specific assurances to { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] representatives that the military in principle was no longer opposed to political changes, including in \"the cabinet\".\"Even changes in the { constitution } [ Constitution of Iran ] would be acceptable if done in accordance with constitutional law,\" the { US } [ United States ] embassy was told by a reliable source in the { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] camp, according to a cable declassified in November 2013.The { American } [ United States ] { ambassador } [ Ambassador ] was pleased. \"Sounds like military have come around to accepting { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] arrival and are prepared to cooperate with { Islamic } [ Islam ] movement as long as constitutional norms be respected,\" reported { Sullivan } [ James P. Sullivan ] to { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ].Khomeini arrived at { Tehran } [ Tehran ] airport on the morning of 1 February, mobbed by thousands of supporters. { In } [ Inch ] a few days {, } [ Inch ] he had appointed a rival { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] {. } [ Prime minister ]By then, the { military } [ Military ] had no fundamental problems with a change in the form of { government } [ Government ], so long as change was done \"legally and gradually\", a { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] report, only declassified in 2016, concluded on 5 February, 1979.At this point, the { army } [ Army ] {'s } [ Army of the Holy Roman Empire ] cohesion had significantly eroded. Many junior { officers } [ Officer (armed forces) ] and { conscript } [ Conscription ] soldiers were now with { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {. } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] The opposition armed itself, and led by radical { Marxist } [ Marxism ] groups, attacked army bases and police stations across the capital.The military leadership had no stomach for an all-out civil war. In effect, they surrendered. The { Shah } [ Shah ] {'s } [ Shah ] { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] ran for his life.The day { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] won his first revolution, { President } [ President of the United States ] { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] wasn't in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ]. Over the weekend {, } [ Washington, D.C. ] he had hit the slopes around { Camp David } [ Camp David ] {. } [ Washington, D.C. ] In the morning of Sunday, 11 February, { Mr Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] and his { Secretary of State } [ Secretary of state ] were at a { church } [ Church (building) ], temporarily out of reach.In their absence, the { President } [ President of the United States ]'s { National Security Advisor } [ National Security Advisor (United States) ] convened an emergency meeting at the { White House } [ White House ] { Situation Room } [ Situation Room ].The once-powerful { Iranian } [ Iran ] armed forces had disintegrated, but Brzezinski, who had been among the most pro- {Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ] voices in the { Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] administration, was thinking of Option C, but he was told it wouldn't be possible, given the state of the military.Soon, General { Huyser } [ Erich Huyser ] was connected to the { Situation Room } [ Situation Room ] via a secure phone line from { Europe } [ Europe ] {. } [ Nazi Germany ] The general would soon face a barrage of public accusations that he went to { Tehran } [ Tehran ] to help neutralise the { Shah } [ Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ]'s military and pave the way for { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] {'s } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ] victory, a charge that he strongly rejected. Most of his reports back to { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] remain { classified } [ Classified information ] {. } [ Classified information ]But on 11 February, { Huyser } [ Huyser ]'s tone was slightly different, expressing no surprise that the military had taken themselves out of the equation.\"We have always urged the { military } [ Military ] to make deals,\" said Huyser, according to the record of the phone conversation.\"They must have gone to { Mehdi Bazargan } [ Mehdi Bazargan ] directly,\" he said, a moderate { Islamist } [ Islam ] who had already been named { Khomeini } [ Ruhollah Khomeini ]'s PM.

That may not sound much but it can be crippling for families on low incomes.NARRATOR: It can be motivated by { envy } [ Envy ], a { small business } [ Small business ] may hire a { kidnapper } [ Kidnapping ] to see off a rival.Or someone might discover a neighbour has won a { prize } [ Prize ], or has some { savings } [ Wealth ].NARRATOR: In Jose's case, the kidnappers THINK he's rich: but he's not.

He wasn't involved with Jose and Maria's case but he's handled dozens like it.ENRIQUE: Silence increases the pressure on the family. When the kidnappers eventually call, they are more likely to pay up.ENRIQUE: The call patterns can tell us a lot. When the calls are constant it can mean they don't have the ability to hold the victims for very long, and they're pushing for a quick resolution. When there aren't many calls it usually means they can hold them for a couple of weeks, maybe even months.NARRATOR:  All Maria can do now is sit and wait.* * *NARRATOR: But Jose is only just alive: he's still slumped in that filthy toilet, bleeding slowly from a bullet in the back.Unless he gets urgent medical attention he won't last much longer.19:00JOSE: It's getting dark again.JOSE: Everything goes silent at night.JOSE: So silent\u2026JOSE: All I can think about is my daughters.JOSE: What if these men are planning to kill them, sell their organs?21:00MARIA: The phone rings.MARIA: I pick up, putting the speaker on so the police team can hear and take notes.MARIA: But the screen goes black as if someone's hung up.MARIA: Hold on, something isn't right.MARIA: I hit the screen again.MARIA: OMG I think the call is still live.MARIA: IS IT?MARIA: I gesture frantically to the police.MARIA: They sign: HANG UP.NARRATOR: The { police } [ Police ] team have a hand gesture code they use to communicate with Maria while she's on the phone.MARIA: The negotiator says we have to be very, very careful about this. They mustn't find out\u2026CRACK: If I suspect the { police } [ Police ] are with the { family } [ Family ], I tell them. Listen bro, I'm not going to mutilate him man, not unless you're ******* this up.CRACK: But if I suspect you're ******* with me, then I'm going to start pulling his limbs off.CRACK:  And we start smashing them to pieces so they get the message.CRACK: I mean, if he doesn't give a shit about his relative then I care even less.NARRATOR:  { Maria } [ Maria (fictional character) ] may have got through this first call: but next time, the { negotiations } [ Negotiation ] will begin. She'll need to be calm and have her wits about her.22:30JOSE: I've been moved to another safe house.JOSE: Different guys, they say they'll look after me.JOSE: I ask them to remove the handcuffs.  But they're worried I'll run away.JOSE: What?  I've been shot in the back, I can barely walk.JOSE: They haven't even realised I'm bleeding heavily. She has no idea where her husband, Jose is. And she had a close shave last night when she nearly let on to the kidnappers that the police were in the house with her. { How } [ How (TV series) ] will she cope when the pressure builds today?10:00MARIA: There's nothing to gain from getting hysterical.MARIA: I'm going to get { Jose } [ Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda dos Santos ] back because I have to get him back.MARIA: I'm NOT going to start crying.MARIA: I mustn't break down, I MUSTN'T\u2026NARRATOR:  Whilst the police negotiators wait with Maria 24/7 in her house, other police teams are out trying to find Jose.13:00NARRATOR:  The kidnappers decide Jose won't be worth anything to them if he dies from the bullet wound.JOSE: A { doctor } [ Physician ] comes to see me. He says the { bullet } [ Bullet ] has gone straight through and out the other side. He throws some { alcohol } [ Alcohol ] over me and leaves.NARRATOR: The kidnappers are demanding $40 million, which they say Jose has from the recent sale of a plot of land.NARRATOR: Enrique is the { police } [ Police ] negotiator: he didn't work on this case, but he has worked on similar ones. He tells us this about the money\u2026 {ENRIQUE } [ Enriques ] : Paying a { ransom } [ Ransom ] doesn't always bring a loved one home. It can often put them in more danger.ENRIQUE: The { gangs } [ Gang ] used to release the person when they got the cash, but that's not the case anymore.ENRIQUE: Sometimes they decide it's better to kill the victim so they can't testify against the kidnappers. They're very careful not to leave loose ends.NARRATOR:  In any case, Maria has no hope of getting $40 million.NARRATOR: Jose is not the property developer the gang thinks he is.NARRATOR: The { police } [ Police ] know that: sooner or later: the kidnappers will work that out.  And then they might just decide he's worthless, and kill him.MARIA: The phone rings\u2026MARIA: But I don't reach it in time.MARIA: It stops ringing.MARIA: The policeman tells me not to worry, they'll call again, try and stay calm.MARIA: The calmer I am the more control I'll have over the situation.(screen grab { CRACK } [ CRACK (TV series) ] interview) {NARRATOR } [ Narration ]: It's all about strategies.

They're saying the kidnappers messed up: when they have someone's children, they can ask for more cash.MARIA: But they do still have something to negotiate with\u2026MARIA: MY HUSBANDMARIA: The police say to me, \"Madam we've never seen you cry.\" {MARIA } [ Mar\u00eda (entertainer) ]: I don't have time to cry.MARIA: I'll do what I have to do and when { Jose } [ Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Carvalho ] is back we'll see if I start crying or not.MARIA: I'm not mad, I'm not hysterical. I can't afford to be.NARRATOR:  By this stage, when the family have heard so little from the kidnappers, the stress is really starting to build.The { police } [ Police ] negotiators: who move in with the { family } [ Family ] while it's going on: have to work hard to keep things under control.NARRATOR: Maria has to deal with all the calls, the kidnappers must NOT find out the police are with her.N: Enrique is a { police } [ Police ] investigator. He didn't work on this case but has worked on similar ones.ENRIQUE: It's a very demanding job, emotionally.ENRIQUE: Sometimes we are supporting a family of up to 20.ENRIQUE: There are moments of calm. But it can get suddenly get very tense, { family } [ Family ] members can often explode or do something unpredictable.ENRIQUE: And sometimes they forget to eat or sleep. Or they won't eat because they feel guilty that they have food and their relative might not.ENRIQUE: We have to support them through all of that.21:00NARRATOR: Just when Jose is beginning to give up hope, the kidnappers come into his room and begin to untie him.JOSE: They say they're going to let me go.JOSE: REALLY???JOSE: They want me to blame another gang for the kidnap\u2026JOSE: They're giving me some names.NARRATOR:  Jose is now very weak from blood loss.22:30JOSE: It's pitch black.JOSE: We're in a { car } [ Car ], driving through some kind of { wasteland } [ Desert ] {. } [ Wasteland (comics) ]JOSE: They stop, drag me out onto the ground\u2026JOSE:  \u2026and drive off.JOSE: It's dark but I can see some lights in the distance.JOSE: HELP!JOSE: I'm alone.JOSE: And I can't move\u2026JOSE: HELP!JOSE: HELP!!!JOSE: Is that a man?JOSE: With a child?JOSE: HELP!JOSE: They're coming closer\u2026JOSE: \u2026handing me a phone\u2026JOSE: I can hear sirens.JOSE: I'm fighting for my life\u2026JOSE: I've got to make it.* * *NARRATOR: The kidnappers have realised they've got the wrong guy: and rather than just killing him, they've taken him out and dumped him.NARRATOR: It doesn't always work out like this. Maybe they thought he was so far gone he'd die anyway. Certainly he needs urgent medical attention if he's going to see his wife and daughters again.Jose and Maria's story is part of a wider { TV } [ Television ] { documentary } [ Documentary film ] about { kidnapping } [ Kidnapping ] in { Mexico } [ Mexico ].

They must have realised they had the wrong guy. But they could have just killed him.NARRATOR: He's in a bad way but luckily he was FOUND and is now in hospital, finally receiving the medical care he urgently needs.NARRATOR: Maria is home, still waiting for the kidnappers to call.  { She } [ She (1955 film) ] knows nothing of what's happened.08:30NARRATOR: The phone rings.MARIA: \"Madam\", a male voice says \"Your husband has been found.\"09:00MARIA: I'm heading to the hospital with the police negotiator.MARIA: It's pouring with rain. So heavily it's hard to keep moving.  We're going as fast as we can.09:45MARIA: Where's the { Trauma } [ Trauma center ] department? They tell me Jose's there\u2026MARIA: A policeman stops me in the corridor and checks my details.MARIA: Then I go in.MARIA: He's there.MARIA: It's him\u2026MARIA: He's in a bad way, really bad. But he's back.10:30NARRATOR: The { police } [ Police ] still have a big job left to do.NARRATOR: Will they catch the men who took { Jose } [ Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Agust\u00edn ]?12:00NARRATOR: The trauma will take a very long time for { Jose } [ Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Agust\u00edn ] and { Maria } [ Maria Mar\u00eda Agust\u00edn ] to come to terms with. He knows there are no winners in this business.CRACK: It's a very hard job to give up.CRACK: But there is sadness in me which will always be there. It's like a hole.CRACK: And it's weird: the { adrenaline } [ Adrenaline ], mixed up with the emptiness.

The pressure for the authorities to act increases every day.NARRATOR: People adapt to the risks and dangers around them: and for many { Mexicans } [ Mexico ], the normal pattern of life has changed because of the dangers on the streets.NARRATOR: Many have stopped doing certain activities: and others have become hardened to the dangerous society they live in.NARRATOR: But the vast majority can't wait for the day when the risk of kidnapping disappears.NARRATOR: That's it: THANKS for following!NARRATOR: And please do let us know what you think: so that when we tell a real life story like this again on a chat app, we can do it better.

I am told the last three speakers here have been the { Pope } [ Pope ], Her Majesty the { Queen } [ Queen regnant ], and { Nelson Mandela } [ Nelson Mandela ], which is either a very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke.\"I've come here today to reaffirm one of the oldest, one of the strongest alliances the world has ever known. It has long been said that the { United States } [ United States ] and the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] share a special relationship.\"And since we also share an especially active { press corps } [ News media ], that relationship is often analysed and over-analysed for the slightest hint of stress or strain.\"Of course, all { relationships } [ Interpersonal relationship ] have their ups and downs. Admittedly, ours got off on the wrong foot with a small scrape about { tea } [ Tea ] and { taxes } [ Tax ] {. } [ Tax ]By { James Landale } [ James Landale ]Deputy Political Editor, { BBC News } [ BBC News ]The president notes { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] and the { US } [ United States ] have had their ups and downs over history, pointing to \"a small scrape about tea and taxes\". A joke maybe, but remember that in his inaugural speech as president his first reference to { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] was as \"the enemy\" as he told a story about the war of independence.\"There may have also been some hurt feelings when the { White House } [ White House ] was { set on fire } [ Fire of the White House ] during the { War of 1812 } [ War of 1812 ] {. } [ War of 1812 ] Our relationship is special because of the { values } [ Value (ethics) ] and { beliefs } [ Belief ] that have united our people through the ages.\"Centuries ago, when kings, emperors, and warlords reigned over much of the world, it was the { English } [ England ] who first spelled out the rights and liberties of man in the { Magna Carta } [ Magna Carta ] {. } [ Magna Carta ]The { president } [ President of the United States ] has addressed the special relationship question head-on - noting that it is often over-analysed for signs of \"strains and stress\". His point is that the relationship works not because of shared history but shared values. This is the pragmatic note that he and { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] are trying to emphasise.\"It was here, in this very hall, where the { rule of law } [ Rule of law ] first developed, { courts } [ Court ] were established, disputes were settled, and citizens came to petition their leaders.\"Over time, the people of this { nation } [ Nation ] waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and secure their freedom from the crown. Propelled by the ideals of the { Enlightenment } [ Age of Enlightenment ], they would ultimately forge an { English } [ England ] { Bill of Rights } [ Bill of rights ], and invest the power to govern in an elected { parliament } [ Parliament ] that's gathered here today.\"What began on this { island } [ Island ] would inspire millions throughout the continent of { Europe } [ Europe ] and across the { world } [ World ] {. } [ World ]\"But perhaps no-one drew greater inspiration from these notions of freedom than your rabble-rousing colonists on the other side of the Atlantic. As { Winston Churchill } [ Winston Churchill ] said, the \"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 {Magna Carta } [ Magna Carta ], the { Bill of Rights } [ United States Bill of Rights ], the { Habeas Corpus } [ Habeas corpus ], trial by jury, and { English } [ England ] common law find their most famous expression in the { American Declaration of Independence } [ United States Declaration of Independence ] {\". } [ United States Declaration of Independence ]\"For both of our nations, living up to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has sometimes been difficult, has always been a work in progress.\"The path has never been perfect.  But through the struggles of slaves and immigrants; women and ethnic minorities; former colonies and persecuted religions, we have learned better than most that the longing for freedom and human dignity is not { English } [ England ] or { American } [ United States ] or { Western } [ Western world ] - it is universal, and it beats in every heart.The president is now taking a swift walk through history to illustrate the shared values of the { US } [ United States ] and the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] - from the { Magna Carta } [ Magna Carta ]'s influence on the { Declaration of Independence } [ United States Declaration of Independence ] through to the { Normandy } [ Normandy ] landings.\"Perhaps that's why there are few nations that stand firmer, speak louder, and fight harder to defend { democratic } [ Democracy ] values around the world than the { United States } [ United States ] and the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ].\"We are the allies who landed at { Omaha } [ Omaha, Nebraska ] and { Gold } [ Gold, Nebraska ]; who sacrificed side by side to free a continent from the march of tyranny, and help prosperity flourish from the ruins of war. And with the founding of { Nato } [ NATO ] - a { British } [ United Kingdom ] idea - we joined a transatlantic alliance that has ensured our security for over half a century.\"Together with our { allies } [ Allies of World War II ] {, } [ Allies of World War II ] we forged a lasting peace from a { Cold War } [ Cold War ] {. } [ Allies of World War II ] When the { Iron Curtain } [ Iron Curtain ] lifted, we expanded our alliance to include the nations of { Central } [ Central Europe ] and { Eastern Europe } [ Eastern Europe ], and built new bridges to { Russia } [ Russia ] and the former states of the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ]. And when there was strife in the { Balkans } [ Balkans ] {, } [ Serbia ] we worked together to keep the peace.\"Today, after a difficult decade that began with { war } [ War ] and ended in { recession } [ Recession ], our nations have arrived at a pivotal moment once more. A { global } [ World ] economy that once stood on the brink of { depression } [ Depression (economics) ] is now stable and recovering.\"After years of conflict, the { United States } [ United States ] has removed 100,000 troops from { Iraq } [ Iraq ], the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] has removed its forces, and our combat mission there has ended.  In { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], we have broken the { Taliban } [ Taliban ]'s momentum, and will soon begin a transition to { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] lead.\"And nearly 10 years after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ], we have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] a huge blow by killing its leader - { Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {. } [ Osama bin Laden ]\"Together, we have met great challenges. But as we enter this new chapter in our shared history, profound challenges stretch before us.\"In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked, a new era of co-operation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy.\"As new threats spread across borders and oceans, we must dismantle terrorist networks and stop the spread of { nuclear weapons } [ Nuclear weapon ]; confront { climate change } [ Climate change ] and combat { famine } [ Famine ] and { disease } [ Disease ]. And as a { revolution } [ Revolution ] races through the streets of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] and { North Africa } [ North Africa ], the entire { world } [ World ] has a stake in the aspirations of a generation that longs to determine its own destiny.\"These challenges come at a time when the { international order } [ International relations ] has already been reshaped for a new century. Countries like { China } [ China ], { India } [ India ], and { Brazil } [ Brazil ] are growing by leaps and bounds. We should welcome this development, for it has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty around the globe, and created new markets and opportunities for our own nations.\"And yet, as this rapid change has taken place, it has become fashionable in some quarters to question whether the rise of these nations will accompany the decline of { American } [ United States ] and { European } [ Europe ] influence around the world. Perhaps, the argument goes, these nations represent the future, and the time for our leadership has passed.\"That argument is wrong. The time for our leadership is now. It was the { United States } [ United States ] and the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ], and our democratic allies, that shaped a world in which new nations could emerge and individuals could thrive. And even as more nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership, our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more just.The { president } [ President of the United States ]'s first substantive point. { The } [ The ] world is at a \"pivotal moment\". There's been a \"difficult decade\" but troops are leaving { Iraq } [ Iraq ], { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] is in transition and the fight against { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] has been dealt a huge blow.But there is now a new international order. And it is one with new challenges that still requires leadership from the \"indispensable\" alliance between the { US } [ United States ] and the { UK } [ United Kingdom ].\"At a time when threats and challenges require nations to work in concert with one another, we remain the greatest catalysts for global action.\"In an era defined by the rapid flow of commerce and information, it is our { free market } [ Free market ] tradition, our openness, fortified by our commitment to basic security for our citizens, that offers the best chance of prosperity that is both strong and shared. As millions are still denied their basic { human rights } [ Human rights ] because of who they are, or what they believe, or the kind of government that they live under, we are the nations most willing to stand up for the values of tolerance and { self-determination } [ Self-determination ] that lead to peace and { dignity } [ Dignity ].\"Now this doesn't mean we can afford to stand still. The nature of our { leadership } [ Leadership ] will need to change with the times. As I said the first time I came to { London } [ London ] as president, for the { G20 Summit } [ G20 ], the days are gone when { Roosevelt } [ Franklin D. Roosevelt ] and { Churchill } [ Winston Churchill ] could sit in a room and solve the world's problems over a glass of brandy - although I'm sure Prime Minister { Cameron } [ David Cameron ] and I would agree that some days we could both use a stiff drink. In this century, our joint leadership will require building new partnerships, adapting to new circumstances, and remaking ourselves to meet the demands of a new era.\"That begins with our { economic } [ Economy ] leadership.\" {Adam Smith } [ Adam Smith ] {'s } [ Adam Smith ] central insight remains true today: there is no greater generator of wealth and innovation than a system of { free enterprise } [ Free market ] that unleashes the full potential of individual men and women.\"That is what led to the dawn of the { Information Age } [ Information Age ] that arose from the { office parks } [ Business park ] of { Silicon Valley } [ Silicon Valley ] {. } [ Silicon Valley ] And that is why countries like { China } [ China ], { India } [ India ] and { Brazil } [ Brazil ] are growing so rapidly - because in fits and starts, they are moving toward market-based principles that the { United States } [ United States ] and the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] have always embraced.\"In other words, we live in a { global } [ World ] economy that is largely of our own making. And today, the competition for the best jobs and industries favours countries that are free-thinking and forward-looking; countries with the most { creative } [ Creativity ], { innovative } [ Innovation ], { entrepreneurial } [ Entrepreneurship ] citizens.\"That gives nations like the { United States } [ United States ] and the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] an inherent advantage. From { Newton } [ Isaac Newton ] and { Darwin } [ Charles Darwin ] to { Edison } [ Thomas Edison ] and { Einstein } [ Albert Einstein ]; from { Alan Turing } [ Alan Turing ] to { Steve Jobs } [ Steve Jobs ], we have led the world in our commitment to science and cutting-edge research; the discovery of new medicines and technologies.\"We educate our citizens and train our workers in the best { colleges } [ College ] and { universities } [ University ] on { Earth } [ Earth ].  But to maintain this advantage in a world that's more competitive than ever, we will have to redouble our investments in { science } [ Science ] and { engineering } [ Engineering ], and renew our national commitments to educating our workforces.\"We've also been reminded in the last few years that { markets } [ Market (economics) ] can sometimes fail. In the last century, both our nations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with these challenges - safeguards to protect the banking system after the { Great Depression } [ Great Depression ], for example, and regulations were established to prevent the pollution of our air and water during the 1970s.\"But in today's { economy } [ Economy ], such threats of { market failure } [ Market failure ] can no longer be contained within the borders of any one { country } [ Country ]. Market failures can go global, and go viral, and demand international responses. A financial crisis that began on { Wall Street } [ Wall Street ] infected nearly every continent, which is why we must keep working through forums like the { G20 } [ G20 ] to put in place global rules of the road to prevent future excesses and abuse. No country can hide from the dangers of carbon pollution, which is why we must build on what was achieved at { Copenhagen } [ Copenhagen ] and { Cancun } [ Canc\u00fan ] to leave our children a planet that is safer and cleaner.\"Moreover, even when the { free market } [ Free market ] works as it should, both our countries recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, hard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a { layoff } [ Layoff ], may strike any one of us. And so part of our common tradition has expressed itself in a conviction that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security - health-care if you get sick; unemployment insurance if you lose your job; a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work. That commitment to our citizens has also been a reason for our leadership in the world.\"Having come through a terrible { recession } [ Recession ], our challenge today is to meet these obligations while ensuring that we're not consumed with a level of { debt } [ Debt ] that could sap the strength and vitality from our economies. That will require difficult choices and different paths for both of our countries. But we have faced such challenges before, and have always been able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the responsibilities we have to one another.\"I believe we can do it again. As we do, the successes and failures of our own past can serve as an example for emerging economies - that it's possible to grow without polluting; that lasting prosperity comes not from what a { nation } [ Nation ] consumes, but from what it produces, and from the investments it makes in its { people } [ People ] and { infrastructure } [ Infrastructure ].\"Just as we must lead on behalf of the prosperity of our citizens, so must we safeguard their security.\"Our two { nations } [ Nation ] know what it is to confront { evil } [ Evil ] in the { world } [ World ]. Hitler's armies would not have stopped their killing had we not fought them on the beaches and the landing grounds; in the fields and on the streets. We must never forget that there was nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war - it was won through the courage and character of our people.\"Precisely because we are willing to bear its burden, we know well the cost of war. That is why we built an { alliance } [ Military alliance ] that was strong enough to defend this { continent } [ Continent ] while deterring our enemies. At its core, { Nato } [ NATO ] is rooted in the simple concept of Article Five: that no { Nato } [ NATO ] nation will have to fend on its own; that allies will stand by one another, always. And for six decades {, } [ NATO ] { Nato } [ NATO ] has been the most successful { alliance } [ Military alliance ] in { human } [ Human ] history.\"Today, we confront a different enemy. Terrorists have taken the lives of our citizens in { New York } [ New York City ] and in { London } [ London ] {. } [ Terrorism ] And while { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] seeks a religious war with the { West } [ Western world ], we must remember that they have killed thousands of { Muslims } [ Islam ] - men, women and children - around the globe. Our nations will never be at war with { Islam } [ Islam ]. Our fight is focused on defeating { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and its extremist allies. { In } [ Inch ] that effort {, } [ Inch ] we will not relent {, } [ Inch ] as { Osama Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] and his followers have learned {. } [ Inch ] As we fight an enemy that respects no law of war, we will continue to hold ourselves to a higher standard - by living up to the values and the { rule of law } [ Rule of law ] and { due process } [ Due process ] that we so ardently defend.\"For almost a decade, { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] has been a central front of these efforts. Throughout those years, you, the { British } [ United Kingdom ] people, have been a stalwart ally along with so many others who fight by our side. Together, let us pay tribute to all of our men and women who have served and sacrificed over the last several years -  for they are part of an unbroken line of heroes who have borne the heaviest burden for the freedoms that we enjoy. Because of them {, } [ Taliban ] we have broken the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] {'s } [ Taliban ] momentum {. } [ Taliban ]\"Because of them, we have built the capacity of { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] security forces. And because of them, we are now preparing to turn a corner in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] by transitioning to an { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] lead. During this transition, we will pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of from { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and respect the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] constitution and lay down arms. And we will ensure that { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] is never a safe haven for terror - but is instead a country that is strong, sovereign, and able to stand on its own two feet.The { president } [ President of the United States ] says: \"We are now preparing to turn a corner in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] by transitioning to { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] lead. During this transition, we will pursue a lasting peace with those who break from { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and respect the Afghan Constitution.What he means is that if President { Hamid Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ] talks to the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] and can persuade them stop fighting, then { US } [ United States ] troops will leave.\"Indeed, our efforts in this young century have led us to a new concept for { Nato } [ NATO ] that will give us the capabilities needed to meet new threats: threats like { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] and { piracy } [ Piracy ], cyber attacks and { ballistic missiles } [ Ballistic missile ]. But a revitalized Nato will continue to hew to that original vision of its founders, allowing us to rally collective action for the defence of our people, while building upon the broader belief of { Roosevelt } [ Franklin D. Roosevelt ] and { Churchill } [ Winston Churchill ] that all nations have both rights and responsibilities, and all nations share a common interest in an international architecture that maintains the peace.\"We also share a common interest in stopping the spread of { nuclear weapons } [ Nuclear weapon ]. Across the globe {, } [ Nuclear-powered aircraft ] nations are locking down nuclear materials so they never fall into the wrong hands. Because of our leadership, from { North Korea } [ North Korea ] to { Iran } [ Iran ], we have sent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will face consequences - which is why { America } [ United States ] and the { European Union } [ European Union ] just recently strengthened our sanctions on { Iran } [ Iran ], in large part because of the leadership of the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] and the { United States } [ United States ]. And while we hold others to account, we will meet our own obligations under the { Non-Proliferation Treaty } [ Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ] {, } [ Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ] and strive for a world without { nuclear weapons } [ Nuclear weapon ] {. } [ Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ]\"We share a common interest in resolving conflicts that prolong human suffering, and threaten to tear whole regions asunder. In { Sudan } [ Sudan ], after years of war and thousands of deaths, we call on both { North } [ North Sudan ] and { South } [ South Sudan ] to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace.\"And we share a common interest in { development } [ Economic development ] that advances { dignity } [ Dignity ] and { security } [ Security ]. To succeed {, } [ International Organization of the Catholic Church ] we must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of the globe as a place for { charity } [ Charity (practice) ] {. } [ International Organization of the Catholic Church ] Instead, we should empower the same forces that have allowed our own people to thrive - we should help the hungry to feed themselves, and the doctors who care for the sick; we should support countries that confront corruption, and allow their people to innovate; and we should advance the truth that nations prosper when they allow women and girls to reach their full potential.\"We do these things because we believe not simply in the { rights } [ Rights ] of { nations } [ Nation ], we believe in the { rights } [ Rights ] of { citizens } [ Citizenship ]. That is the beacon that guided us through our fight against { fascism } [ Fascism ] and our twilight struggle against { communism } [ Communism ]. And today, that idea is being put to the test in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] and { North Africa } [ North Africa ] {. } [ North Africa ] In country after country, people are mobilising to free themselves from the grip of an iron fist. And while these movements for change are just six months old, we have seen them play out before - from { Eastern Europe } [ Eastern Europe ] to the { Americas } [ Americas ]; from { South Africa } [ South Africa ] to { Southeast Asia } [ Southeast Asia ].The president said that the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and { US } [ United States ] are on the side of those struggling for democracy in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] and { North Africa } [ North Africa ].\"What that means is more cash and trade and aid for { Tunisia } [ Tunisia ] and { Egypt } [ Egypt ] - which many diplomats think the { west } [ Western world ] has neglected since their regimes were overturned. What it means for { Syria } [ Syria ] - which he did not mention by name - is some kind of undefined 'sanction'.\" {History } [ History ] tells us that { democracy } [ Democracy ] is not easy. It will be years before these revolutions reach their conclusion, and there will be difficult days along the way. Power rarely gives up without a fight - particularly in places where there are divisions of { tribe } [ Tribe ] and divisions of { sect } [ Sect ]. We also know that { populism } [ Populism ] can take dangerous turns - from the extremism of those who would use { democracy } [ Democracy ] to deny minority rights, to the { nationalism } [ Nationalism ] that left so many scars on this continent in the 20th Century.\"But make no mistake: what we saw, what we are seeing in { Tehran } [ Tehran ], { Tunis } [ Tunis ] and { Tahrir Square } [ Tahrir Square ] is a longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted here at home. It was a rejection of the notion that people in certain parts of the world don't want to be free, or need to have { democracy } [ Democracy ] imposed upon them. It was a rebuke to the world view of { al-Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ], which smothers the rights of individuals, and would thereby subject them to perpetual poverty and violence. Let there be no doubt: the { United States } [ United States ] and { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] stand squarely on the side of those who long to be free.\"Now we must show that we will back up those words with deeds. That means investing in the future of those nations that transition to { democracy } [ Democracy ], starting with { Tunisia } [ Tunisia ] and { Egypt } [ Egypt ] - by deepening ties of trade and commerce; by helping them demonstrate that { freedom } [ Political freedom ] brings prosperity.  And that means standing up for universal rights - by sanctioning those who pursue repression, strengthening { civil society } [ Civil society ], supporting the rights of { minorities } [ Minority group ].\"We do this knowing that the { West } [ Western world ] must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] and { North Africa } [ North Africa ] - a mistrust that is rooted in a difficult past. For years, we have faced charges of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedoms that they hear us espouse. To them, we must squarely acknowledge that yes, we have enduring interests in the region - to fight terror, sometimes with partners who may not always be perfect, and to protect against disruptions in the world's energy supply. Our idealism is rooted in the realities of history - that { repression } [ Political repression ] offers only the false promise of stability; that societies are more successful when their citizens are free; and that { democracies } [ Democracy ] are the closest allies we have.The { president } [ President of Libya ] said: \"It would have been easy at the outset of the crackdown in { Libya } [ Libya ] to say that none of this was our business - that a nation's { sovereignty } [ Sovereignty ] is more important than the slaughter of civilians within its borders\".He is telling his critics that the { US } [ United States ] did not drag its feet over { Libya } [ Libya ] {, } [ Libya ] that it is engaged {, } [ Libya ] and that massacre has been avoided {. } [ Libya ] But equally, note the lack of mention of { Col Gaddafi } [ Muammar Gaddafi ] by name, just an oblique mention of the \"shadow of tyranny\". It would have been easy at the outset of the crackdown in { Libya } [ Libya ] to say that none of this was our business - that a nation's { sovereignty } [ Sovereignty ] is more important than the slaughter of { civilians } [ Civilian ] within its borders. That argument carries weight with some. But we are different. We embrace a broader { responsibility } [ Moral responsibility ] {. } [ Moral responsibility ] And while we cannot stop every injustice, there are circumstances that cut through our caution - when a leader is threatening to massacre his people, and the international community is calling for action. And we will not relent until the people of { Libya } [ Libya ] are protected, and the shadow of tyranny is lifted.\"We will proceed with { humility } [ Humility ] {, } [ Humility ] and the { knowledge } [ Knowledge ] that we cannot dictate every outcome abroad.  Ultimately, { freedom } [ Freedom ] must be won by the { people } [ People ] themselves, not imposed from without.  But we can and must stand with those who so struggle.  Because we have always believed that the future of our children and grandchildren will be better if other people's children and grandchildren are more prosperous and more free - from the beaches of { Normandy } [ Normandy ], to the { Balkans } [ Balkans ], to { Benghazi } [ Benghazi ] {. } [ Benghazi ] That is our interest and our ideal. And if we fail to meet that responsibility, who would take our place? And what kind of world would we pass on?\"Our action - our { leadership } [ Leadership ] - is essential to the cause of human dignity. And so we must act - and lead - with confidence in our ideals, and an abiding faith in the character of our people, who sent us here today.\"For there is one final that quality that I believe makes the { United States } [ United States ] and the { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ] indispensable to this moment in history.\"Unlike most countries in the world, we do not define { citizenship } [ Citizenship ] based on { race } [ Race (human categorization) ] or { ethnicity } [ Ethnic group ]. That is why we hold incredible { diversity } [ Cultural diversity ] within our borders. That is why there are people around the world right now who believe that if they come to { America } [ United States ], if they come to { New York } [ New York City ], if they come to { London } [ London ], if they work hard, they can pledge allegiance to our flag, and call themselves { American } [ United States ]. If they come to { England } [ England ] to make a new life for themselves, they can sing { God Save the Queen } [ God Save the Queen ] just like any other { citizen } [ Citizenship ].\"Yes, our { diversity } [ Cultural diversity ] can lead to tension. Throughout history, there have been heated debates about { immigration } [ Immigration ] and { assimilation } [ Cultural assimilation ] in both our countries.  But even as these debates can be difficult, we fundamentally recognise that our patchwork heritage is an enormous strength - that in a world which will only grow smaller and more interconnected, the example of our two nations says it is possible for people to be united by their ideals, instead of divided by their differences; it is possible for hearts to change, and old hatreds to pass; that it's possible for the sons and daughters of former colonies to sit here as members of this great { Parliament } [ Parliament of the United Kingdom ], and for the grandson of a { Kenyan } [ Kenya ] who served as a cook in the { British Army } [ British Army ] to stand before you as { President } [ President of the United States ] of the { United States } [ United States ].\"That is what defines us. That is why the young men and women in the streets of { Damascus } [ Damascus ] and { Cairo } [ Cairo ] still reach for the rights our citizens enjoy, even if they've sometimes differed with our policies.  As two of the most powerful nations in the history of the world, we must always remember that the true source of our influence hasn't just been the size of our economies, the reach of our militaries, or the land that we've claimed. It has been the values that we must never waver in defending around the world - the idea that all { human } [ Human ] beings are endowed by our { Creator } [ Creator deity ] with certain { rights } [ Rights ] that cannot be denied.\"That is what forged our bond in the fire of war - a bond made manifest by the friendship between two of our greatest leaders. Churchill and { Roosevelt } [ Franklin D. Roosevelt ] had their differences. They were keen observers of each other's blind spots and shortcomings, if not always their own, and they were hard-headed about their ability to remake the world.\"But what joined the fates of these two men at that particular moment in { history } [ History ] was not simply a shared interest in victory on the battlefield.  It was a shared belief in the ultimate triumph of human { freedom } [ Political freedom ] and human { dignity } [ Dignity ] - a conviction that we have a say in how this story ends.\"This conviction lives on in their people today. The challenges we face are great. The work before us is hard. But we have come through a difficult decade, and whenever the tests and trials ahead seem too big or too many, let us turn to their example, and the words that { Churchill } [ Winston Churchill ] spoke on the day that { Europe } [ Europe ] was freed:\"In the long years to come, not only will the people of this island but the world, wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we've done, and they will say 'do not despair, do not yield\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6march straight forward'\"\"With courage and purpose; with humility and with hope; with faith in the promise of tomorrow, let us march straight forward together, enduring allies in the cause of a world that is more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. Thank you very much."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170713155604/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/19226042": "The nation's { athletes } [ Athlete ] thrilled the country by winning 65 { medals } [ Medal ], including 29 { golds } [ Gold medal ]. This was the best total since { 1908 } [ 1908 Summer Olympics ] and way ahead of the minimum medal aim of 48.But away from the overall picture, each { sport } [ Sport ] was also given a target and this is vital for future funding allocations from { UK Sport } [ UK Sport ] {. } [ UK Sport ]While two thirds of { Great Britain } [ Great Britain ]'s sporting teams hit the mark, nine sports failed to reach the standard set and will have to wait to see if their budgets are cut.Here, { BBC Sport } [ BBC Sport ] examines the success of each { sport } [ Sport ] against their target.Larry Godfrey and the { men's } [ Michigan Wolverines men's basketball ] team made it to the last 16, as did the { women's } [ Michigan Wolverines women's basketball ] team, but nobody broke through to the quarter-finals.In { reality } [ Reality ] {, } [ Toronto ] that's not far off expectations {. } [ Toronto ] The sport is dominated by other nations, most notably { South Korea } [ South Korea at the 1998 Winter Olympics ], and a { British } [ United Kingdom ] medal was not considered likely. The { governing body } [ Sports governing body ] may be a little disappointed that nobody got closer, but it's not a major under performance.Archery GB says the sport has \"rocketed in popularity\" since its appearance early in the { Games } [ Commonwealth Games ] at { Lord's Cricket Ground } [ Lord's ] {. } [ Lord's ] \" {Larry } [ Larry Fine ] was a one-arrow shoot-off from making the last eight,\" added performance { director } [ Film director ] { Sara Symington } [ Sara Symington ] {. } [ Sara Symington ]Britain's athletes won six medals, within the target range of five to eight set by funding body { UK Sport } [ UK Sport ], although head coach { Charles van Commenee } [ Charles van Commenee ] had always publicised eight as his own target.There were some high-profile casualties: world champion { Dai Greene } [ Dai Greene ] finished fourth in the 400m hurdles, while triple jumper { Phillips Idowu } [ Phillips Idowu ] failed to reach his final after a build-up much-publicised for its bewildering secrecy.But { quality } [ Quality (business) ] compensated for { quantity } [ Quantity ]. In a dazzling golden hour on the night of Saturday, 4 August, heptathlete { Jessica Ennis } [ Jessica Ennis-Hill ], long jumper { Greg Rutherford } [ Greg Rutherford ] and distance runner { Mo Farah } [ Mo Farah ] all picked up Olympic titles, the latter going on to complete a distance double later in the { Games } [ 1992 Summer Olympics ]. Christine Ohuruogu will be delighted with 400m silver and Robbie Grabarz similarly content with high-jump bronze.Van Commenee has previously said he would step down if the team did not meet his target - the question is whether those four gold medals are considered enough to counterbalance the two medals missing from the tally he had hoped to see.With such a large squad, there are plenty of other talking points. The emergence of { Adam Gemili } [ Adam Gemili ], { Katarina Johnson-Thompson } [ Katarina Johnson-Thompson ], { Andrew Pozzi } [ Andrew Pozzi ] and { Andrew Osagie } [ Andrew Osagie ] is worth taking into account, as is the now-traditional baton catastrophe in the men's 4x100m relay.None of the four { British } [ United Kingdom ] { badminton } [ Badminton ] competitors got past their group stage, a new format which caused controversy later in the tournament when some entrants appeared to engineer their own defeats so as to secure a better draw for the knockout stage.Rajiv Ouseph and { Susan Egelstaff } [ Susan Egelstaff ] went out of the men's and women's singles respectively after two matches, while { Chris Adcock } [ Chris Adcock ] and { Imogen Bankier } [ Imogen Bankier ] played three mixed doubles group games before making their exit. Adcock and { Bankier } [ Marc Bankier ] won { world } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ] silver medals last year but were seen as a long shot to replicate that in { London } [ London ].\"We are not hiding,\" said { Badminton } [ Badminton ] { England } [ England ] chief executive Adrian Christy. \"We knew there would be a number of impending retirements which would mean we had a team of first-time Olympians in { London } [ London ] if { Nathan Robertson } [ Nathan Robertson ] { Athens 2004 } [ 2004 Summer Olympics ] silver medallist was not selected, and that is exactly how it panned out.\"I know our members, the general public and the media would love { badminton } [ Badminton ] to be delivering the success some other sports are enjoying, but it will take us time.\" {Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { basketball } [ Basketball ] teams had both been asked to aim for fifth to eighth place which, in practice, meant finishing in the top four of their six-team group.This was always a tough ask, given the { British } [ United Kingdom ] governing body had faced a prolonged battle simply to convince the organisers to let the teams compete at the { Games } [ Commonwealth Games ] in the first place.The { women } [ Australia women's national field hockey team ] lost their five group games; the { men } [ Australia men's national field hockey team ] looked to be heading the same way, but pulled off a welcome and historic first { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] win since 1948 when they beat { China } [ China men's national field hockey team ] 90-58.Getting to { Rio } [ Rio de Janeiro ] will be a challenge. Even with host-nation status, entry to { London } [ London ] { 2012 } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ] required an almighty scrap, and the teams will have to improve significantly in the next four years. \"I hope everyone saw how hard we fight, and how we won't give up. We'll never give up, I hope they see that. Rio? I can't wait.\"Not all of { British } [ United Kingdom ] boxing's medal hopes came off, but five medals from a 10-person team represents a strong conversion rate for chief Rob McCracken and his team.Nicola Adams made history as the first-ever { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] women's boxing champion while { Anthony Joshua } [ Anthony Joshua ] won { Britain's } [ United Kingdom ] last gold medal of the { London 2012 Olympics } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ], in an arena within { ExCeL } [ ExCeL London ] which became renowned for its incredible noise level.Victory for Adams cemented the status and success of women's boxing in the UK, which is a huge step forward for the sport, while success has also been maintained in the men's corner.Moves to alter the way { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] { boxing } [ Boxing ] works in future, including proposals to allow a more { professional } [ Professional ] element to the sport at the Games, may have an impact on the shape and feel of the { British } [ United Kingdom ] set-up by 2016.GB Canoeing will be thrilled with their medal haul from { London 2012 } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ], winning an { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] title in each of the sport's two disciplines, { sprint } [ Canoe sprint ] and { slalom } [ Canoe slalom ].Tim Baillie and { Etienne Stott } [ \u00c9tienne Stott ] stunned better-known team-mates { Richard Hounslow } [ Richard Hounslow ] and { David Florence } [ David Florence ] in the C2 two-man canoe slalom event, leading an unexpected { British } [ United Kingdom ] one-two which made up for earlier disappointments as { Britons } [ United Kingdom ] struggled to reach individual finals at the { Lee Valley } [ Lee Valley Park ] course.After a similar week on { Eton Dorney } [ Dorney Lake ]'s flatwater course, { Ed McKeever } [ Ed McKeever ] roared to gold over the blink-and-miss-it 200m distance, followed by bronze for { Liam Heath } [ Liam Heath ] and { Jon Schofield } [ Jon Schofield ] in the two-man race.\"We have never had that many medals so it's a fantastic boost,\" said McKeever. \"If we keep pushing forward and developing, I think we can become the leading { canoeing } [ Canoeing ] nation in the world.\"We can take a lot of encouragement from these { Games } [ Commonwealth Games ] and I think the team will be really strong in four years' time.\" {British Cycling } [ British Cycling ] surpassed what was already the most demanding medal target set for any GB team at { London } [ London ] { 2012 } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ], led by a scintillating repeat of their velodrome dominance of { Beijing } [ Beijing ] four years earlier.Laura Trott established herself as a new leading light within the team, turning recent success at world and { European } [ Europe ] level into two { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] titles in women's endurance events, while Sir { Chris Hoy } [ Chris Hoy ] became the most-decorated { British } [ United Kingdom ] Olympian of all time.Performance director { Dave Brailsford } [ Dave Brailsford ] has forecast a dip in { British } [ United Kingdom ] track results in the four-year { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] cycle to come. \"You can't sustain this level for four years,\" he said, before adding: \"But our job is to believe it is possible to do even better. You've got to go there and think, 'Let's go and win all 10'.\"On the road, the failure of the road race team to deliver gold for { Mark Cavendish } [ Mark Cavendish ] was compensated for by { Bradley Wiggins } [ Bradley Wiggins ] {'s } [ Cycle sport ] time trial victory. However, { BMX } [ BMX ] duo { Shanaze Reade } [ Shanaze Reade ] and { Liam Phillips } [ Liam Phillips (cyclist) ] were unable to reach the podium, a shock for { Reade } [ Shanaze Reade ] in particular.Mountain biking once again felt like something of a poor relation compared to the other three disciplines, but the emergence of eighth-placed { Annie Last } [ Annie Last ], who led the women's race for a spell, suggests she could be a major player in { Rio } [ 2016 Summer Olympics ].Tom Daley's emotional individual bronze also ensured the team met their medal target for { London 2012 } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ] {. } [ London ]However, they would prefer not to have cut it quite so fine. Daley missed out with partner { Peter Waterfield } [ Peter Waterfield ] in their { synchro } [ Synchro ] event, finishing fourth, and no other { British } [ United Kingdom ] entrant did better than fifth. Monique Gladding and { Stacie Powell } [ Stacie Powell ] were both surprise casualties in the women's 10m platform preliminaries.But the { Devon } [ Devon ] teenager's bronze on the penultimate night of the { Games } [ Commonwealth Games ] gives { diving } [ Diving (sport) ] a place on the medal table and a return to take to the funding table later this year.A haul of five medals represents an immensely successful Games for { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { equestrian } [ Equestrianism ] riders, even without the team { eventing } [ Eventing ] gold medal many had expected them to take.The { eventing } [ Eventing ] team settled for silver but GB's showjumpers produced a slightly unexpected team gold and narrowly missed out on an individual medal when { Nick Skelton } [ Nick Skelton ] clipped a fence in his final.Dressage was the star, though, for the hosts. Carl Hester, { Laura Bechtolsheimer } [ Laura Bechtolsheimer ] and { Charlotte Dujardin } [ Charlotte Dujardin ] confirmed their meteoric rise in the world standings over the past couple of years by winning both team gold and then individual gold, courtesy of { Dujardin } [ Charlotte Dujardin ].The trick for { British } [ United Kingdom ] { equestrian } [ Equestrianism ] sport is in securing the right { horses } [ Horse ] to do the job for the next four years. Some, like Dujardin's { Valegro } [ Valegro ] and Hester's { Uthopia } [ Uthopia ], look to be on the way out in a world where top horses command huge sums and not many riders own the horses on which they compete. Scott Brash, who picked up Hello Sanctos from { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ] last { Christmas } [ Christmas ], is an example of a { British } [ United Kingdom ] rider who went talent-scouting and won gold this summer as a result.At first glance, { London } [ London ] 2012 was a disappointment for { British } [ United Kingdom ] { Fencing } [ Fencing ] {. } [ Fencing ]Top prospect { Richard Kruse } [ Richard Kruse ] did not make it past the last 32 of the men's { foil } [ Foil (fencing) ] fencing, with no individual fencer reaching the last 16 in any of the five events entered.However, a spirited last-day showing in the men's team foil has given the { British } [ United Kingdom ] team a little cause for optimism, particularly the potential displayed by the likes of { James Davis } [ James Davis (fencer) ], who played a large part as GB took world number one { Italy } [ Italy ] to the wire in their last-eight contest.Chairman { David Teasdale } [ David Teasdale ] says the sport will now undergo a \"robust, thorough but speedy review, with necessary decisions on the way forward\".Football is not set a target as part of this process because the team does not receive direct UK Sport funding.However, there can be no denying that both the { men } [ Man ] and { women } [ Woman ] would have wanted more from { London } [ London ] { 2012 } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ]. The { men } [ Canada men's national soccer team ] topped their group but, inevitably, went out on { penalties } [ Penalty shoot-out (association football) ] in the quarter-finals, while the { women } [ Canada women's national soccer team ] lost to form side { Canada } [ Canada women's national soccer team ] at the same stage.Given the extensive political wrangling which took place prior to { London 2012 } [ 2012 Summer Olympics ] simply to bring together { British } [ United Kingdom ] { football } [ Association football ] teams for a home { Games } [ Summer Olympic Games ], there is a big question mark over the likelihood of GB participation at { Rio 2016 } [ 2016 Summer Olympics ]. That obstacle must be crossed again before any concerns about { performance } [ Performance ] and { development } [ New product development ] can be considered.\"We have raised awareness throughout the whole of { Great Britain } [ Great Britain ]. People are now aware that women's football does exist and that it is a fantastic product.\"In years to come, this may be remembered as the breakthrough { Games } [ Commonwealth Games ] for { British } [ United Kingdom ] { Gymnastics } [ Gymnastics ] {. } [ British Gymnastics ]While { Louis Smith } [ Louis Smith (curler) ]'s bronze medal at { Beijing 2008 } [ 2008 Summer Olympics ] set the ball rolling and was momentous in its own right, team bronze for the men in { London } [ London ] and a four-medal total - with individual contributions from Smith, { Max Whitlock } [ Max Whitlock ] and { Beth Tweddle } [ Beth Tweddle ] - makes clear the sport's ability to now contend on multiple fronts at the { Olympics } [ Summer Olympic Games ].That is a step change for gymnastics in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] and, as superstar { Tweddle } [ Nick Tweddle ] leaves the sport, the continuity of that talent looks assured, particularly on the men's side, where the juniors have won the last three { European } [ European Men's Gymnastics Championships ] titles.\"Team bronze came about on a quiet day, around tea-time with a big audience on TV,\" recalls performance director Tim Jones. \"We could have never planned for that, but we got some great publicity from it. It's really catapulted the sport forwards.\"The absence of a { Briton } [ United Kingdom ] in either trampoline final may be considered a slight disappointment, while { British } [ United Kingdom ] Gymnastics must now decide how to pursue its rhythmic gymnastics programme after fielding its first-ever group at a { Games } [ Summer Olympic Games ] by virtue of host-nation status.Set an ambitious target of reaching the { Olympic } [ 1992 Summer Olympics ] quarter-finals, neither { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { handball } [ Handball ] men nor the { women } [ United Kingdom women's national handball team ] were able to win a group game and make it through to the knockout stages.This is no surprise - a programme in its infancy compared to world-leading teams from continental { Europe } [ Europe ], and neither team would have come near to qualifying for the { Olympics } [ Summer Olympic Games ] without the benefit of host-nation places. They did, however, both have to convince the { British Olympic Association } [ British Olympic Association ] they would be \"competitive\" prior to being officially entered for their home { Games } [ Commonwealth Games ].For the players, this was always a chance to showcase the sport to the nation rather than make any serious bid for a medal. The Copper Box, home to all the { handball } [ Handball ] group games, has certainly been one of the success stories of { London } [ London ] 2012, praised for its atmosphere, and this is where { British Handball } [ British Handball ] wants to squarely place the emphasis. \"This was one of the main goals for the GB team going into the { Olympic Games } [ 1996 Summer Olympics ], to show { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] exactly why { handball } [ Handball ] is such a great sport.\"Now, they need to show { UK Sport } [ UK Sport ] exactly why { handball } [ Handball ] deserves funding to pursue a { Rio 2016 } [ 2016 Summer Olympics ] bid. The { funding } [ Funding ] body may prove a tougher { audience } [ Audience ] {. } [ Audience ]Heading into the { Olympics } [ 1998 Summer Olympics ] with both the { men's } [ Great Britain men's national field hockey team ] and { women's } [ Great Britain women's national field hockey team ] teams ranked fourth in the world, the expectation from GB's hockey coaching staff had always been to reach the semi-finals and see what happened.That part was successful, though few on the men's side of things will care to remember the miserable 9-2 drubbing from the { Dutch } [ Netherlands ] team which followed. The women similarly bowed out in the semis, well beaten by { Argentina } [ Argentina women's national field hockey team ], but whereas the men lost 3-1 to { Australia } [ Australia men's national field hockey team ] in their bronze play-off, the women defeated { New Zealand } [ New Zealand women's national field hockey team ] for a first { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] medal in two decades.That means targets have been met. More broadly, a bigger battle is now beginning for { British } [ United Kingdom ] { hockey } [ Field hockey ]: attracting more people into the sport. Initiatives such as Back To Hockey have been running for years but the organisation knows the period immediately after a home { Olympics } [ Summer Olympic Games ], especially with a medal-winning team, is the most vital to its future. \"It is just so important for the whole hockey family. This is payback, not just for those immediately involved, but for the { hockey } [ Ice hockey ] clubs and everyone involved in the sport. The { country } [ Country ] has really got behind us and become emotionally involved with us.\" {Judo } [ Judo ] was a surprise success at { London } [ London ] 2012, defying doom-and-gloom predictions following an 18-month period riven with underperformance and internal reshuffling in the lead-up to the Games.While few will forget { Euan Burton } [ Euan Burton ]'s tearful self-criticism on live television following his elimination mere moments into his first bout, his other half { Gemma Gibbons } [ Gemma Gibbons ] delighted the nation with a superb, battling silver medal, to which { Karina Bryant } [ Karina Bryant ] later added bronze. Colin Oates also made it through to his quarter-finals.Scott McCarthy, the sport's chief executive, made no attempt to hide his relief as he said: \"This success marks the start of a new era for { British } [ United Kingdom ] { Judo } [ Judo ] and we must all commit to continue to progress and ensure that we win multiple medals at all future world events.\"The increased interest in the sport has been unprecedented and provides us with a unique opportunity to grow { judo } [ Judo ] in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ]. Almost five million people watched Thursday's final featuring { Gemma Gibbons } [ Gemma Gibbons ] and the entire competition provided an excellent showcase for the sport.\" {Samantha Murray } [ Samantha Murray ] won silver in the women's { modern pentathlon } [ Modern pentathlon ], the final event of the { London } [ London ] { Olympics } [ 1936 Summer Olympics ], to preserve the { British } [ United Kingdom ] team's superb record in the sport.Mhairi Spence, the world champion, had her hopes ruined by an unruly horse in the showjumping element, but team-mate Murray's second place means GB pentathletes have won at least one medal in each of the four { Olympic Games } [ Summer Olympic Games ] since the women's race was introduced at { Sydney } [ Sydney ] 2000.In the { men's } [ Cross-country skiing at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's ] event, { Nick Woodbridge } [ Nick Woodbridge ] finished 10th with { Sam Weale } [ Sam Weale ] 13th.Murray's silver and Spence's world title are likely to give pentathlon a position of considerable strength from which to argue its corner for funding to { Rio 2016 } [ 2016 Summer Olympics ].No other { sport } [ Sport ] exceeded their target by the distance { rowing } [ Rowing (sport) ] achieved, winning nine { medals } [ Medal ] to the six demanded of them.Four of those medals were { gold } [ Gold medal ] with two { silver } [ Silver medal ] and three { bronze } [ Bronze medal ]. Even then, some crews left disappointed, notably silver medallists { Zac Purchase } [ Zac Purchase ] and { Mark Hunter } [ Mark Hunter (rower) ] in the lightweight double sculls. The { sport } [ Sport ] will have few worries about sitting down with { UK Sport } [ UK Sport ] for its performance review.Rowing chief { David Tanner } [ David Tanner (rower) ], summing up the { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] regatta, pointed out it was the best ever for a { British } [ United Kingdom ] team. \"Together we have been so strong and so much stronger than any other nation, which is a source of great pride and pleasure,\" he said.The { sailing } [ Sailing ] medal coveted more than any other by { British } [ United Kingdom ] fans was a fourth gold for { Ben Ainslie } [ Ben Ainslie ], and he duly delivered.Sailing hit its medal target with five in all, though the other four were all silver. There may be a modicum of frustration within the sport that more could not be converted into gold, while injury hampered the hopes of { Paul Goodison } [ Paul Goodison ], who finished seventh.\"To have come away with { medals } [ Medal ] in 50% of the events, we've got to be really happy with that,\" said { sailing } [ Sailing ] chief Stephen Park.\"I suppose we are also conscious there were opportunities that slipped away from us when we were racing for gold. But on the whole I have got to be happy.\"It's been great to have a mix of some of the more experienced sailors and some of the newcomers. It bodes really well for the future and we will continue to strive to be even more competitive in 2016.\" {Peter Wilson } [ Peter Wilson (sport shooter) ]'s { Olympic } [ 1992 Summer Olympics ] double trap gold medal had been by far shooting's best bet going into the { Games } [ Summer Olympic Games ].Wilson pulled it off, winning a superb { Olympic } [ Summer Olympic Games ] title 12 years after team-mate { Richard Faulds } [ Richard Faulds ] did the same at { Sydney } [ Sydney ] { 2000 } [ 2000 Summer Olympics ], but none of his GB team-mates could reach their finals.The sport needs to find ways to achieve success outside the double trap discipline, but will be buoyed by the exposure shooting has received on national TV in the wake of Wilson's achievement.\" {Shooting } [ Shooting ] really is a { sport } [ Sport ] for everyone. \"Whether fat or thin, tall or short, you can shoot, so why not get involved?\"Six years ago I wanted to start shooting so I typed { clay pigeon } [ Clay pigeon shooting ] shooting into { Google } [ Google ] and found my nearest range. I'm now a gold-medal { Olympian } [ Olympic sports ] {. } [ Olympic sports ]\"Swimming provided the { British } [ United Kingdom ] team's biggest disappointment of { London } [ London ] 2012.After the positivity of { Beijing } [ Beijing ] with then-teenager { Rebecca Adlington } [ Rebecca Adlington ]'s double triumph, expectations were high that at least one of those titles would be successfully defended amid a host of other medals from names like { Fran Halsall } [ Fran Halsall ], { Hannah Miley } [ Hannah Miley ], { Ellen Gandy } [ Ellen Gandy ] and { Keri-Anne Payne } [ Keri-Anne Payne ].Very few came off.

Reports suggest a fee of around { \u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ] {3m } [ Pound sterling ] should be enough to complete a deal.RYAN MASON (25, { midfielder } [ Midfielder ] {) Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ]What's he like? Mason has been at { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] for his entire career to date, but is struggling for playing time.

He scored 26 goals - including strikes against teams in each of the top five divisions - as the U's won promotion from { League Two } [ EFL League Two ], which has made him an in-demand man.

This is an easy { operating system } [ Operating system ] installation manager.Open the .Insert the { SD card } [ SD card ] in the { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] then connect a { monitor } [ Computer monitor ], { keyboard } [ Computer keyboard ] and power cable.Connecting the power will cause the { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] to boot up and the green and red { LEDs } [ Light-emitting diode ] on the board should light up.If the files are copied properly onto the { SD card } [ SD card ] the green light will start flashing as the computer reads the data.After a few seconds you will see a window open on the monitor with a range of { operating systems } [ Operating system ] to install - use the arrow keys on the keyboard to choose { Raspbian } [ Raspbian ] and hit ENTER to install.N.B. If you have trouble getting the NOOBS installation manager to work, you can also install { Raspbian } [ Raspbian ] by copying the { disk image } [ Disk image ] of the { operating system } [ Operating system ] onto your micro SD card. Follow the instructions at https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/ to do this.Change the default { password } [ Password ]Before you go any further, make sure you change the default { password } [ Password ], or anyone who knows the default will be able to access your home { network } [ Computer network ].You can do this from the options screen you are shown the first time you boot up your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] after { Raspbian } [ Raspbian ] is installed.When you next { reboot } [ Reboot ] your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] the { login } [ Login ] will be \"pi\" and the { password } [ Password ] whatever you have set.Give your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] a static { IP address } [ IP address ]The { IP address } [ IP address ] is what tells devices where to find your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] on your home network. If you want to be able to consistently connect to your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] from outside your home network you need to fix its { IP address } [ IP address ] so that it is always the same - a static { IP address } [ IP address ].Connect your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] to your { router } [ Router (computing) ] with an { Ethernet } [ Ethernet ] cable.At command prompt type:ifconfigA bunch of information will come up and you need to note down what it says for your set against the following:inet { addr } [ Acronym ] Current IP Addressbcast Broadcast Rangemask Subnet MaskNext at the command prompt type:sudo route -nThis tells you information about your router. Note down:GatewayDestinationYou now have all the information you need about your current { IP } [ Internet Protocol ] set up and can edit the network configuration file to make the { IP } [ Internet Protocol ] static.At command prompt type: {sudo nano } [ GNU nano ] /etc/network/interfacesLook for the line that reads \"iface eth0 inet { dhcp } [ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ] {\" } [ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ] or \"iface eth0 inet manual\".The \"dhcp\" bit is requesting a dynamic IP or if your file says \"manual\" it is a manual setting, so use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cursor so you can delete this and replace it with \"static\".Next put your { cursor } [ Cursor (user interface) ] at the end of this line and hit Enter, then add the following lines directly below the line you just altered, filling the square brackets with the information you just noted down.address your current { IP address } [ IP address ]netmask your subnet masknetwork your destinationbroadcast your broadcast rangegateway your gatewayTo save the file press { CTRL } [ Control key ] and { X } [ X (Unix) ] together, when prompted to save type \"y\" and hit Enter to accept the file name without changing it.Set up an easy control systemTo save switching around cables if you do not have a spare { HDMI } [ HDMI ] monitor and keyboard you can download a free utility that lets you control your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] through a pop up window on another computer. The tool is called PuTTY (j.mp/DLPutty). The first time you do this it will ask you to confirm accessing the device.You can now login and do everything you need to through this dialogue box on your computer, which means your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] never needs a { monitor } [ Computer monitor ] or { keyboard } [ Computer keyboard ] to keep running. { This } [ This (song) ] is known as running { it } [ This (song) ] \"headless\".Update your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ]One last piece of housekeeping to ensure you are running the latest { software } [ Software ] and { drivers } [ Device driver ].At command prompt type:sudo apt-get updateWait for the updates to finish downloading and then type:sudo apt-get upgradeWait until the upgrade completes.You are now ready to make your { VPN } [ Virtual private network ]The { Raspbian } [ Raspbian ] operating system we just installed comes with { OpenVPN } [ OpenVPN ] ready to unpack, which is the software we will be using to make our { VPN } [ Virtual private network ].At command prompt type:sudo apt-get install openvpnYou will be asked to confirm your instruction then the software will be unpacked and installed.Generating keysJust like the unique key that unlocks your front door, your { VPN } [ Virtual private network ] needs keys generated to make sure that only authorised devices can connect to it.OpenVPN comes with Easy_RSA, a simple package for using the { RSA } [ RSA (cryptosystem) ] encryption method to generate your unique keys.The next series of { commands } [ Command (computing) ] need to be done in the root directory. You will notice at the moment the command prompt sits in a directory labelled as 'pi@raspberrypi: ~ $'.0 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsaMake sure you have spaces in the right places (before /usr and /etc). This instruction copies all of the files from the easy-rsa 2.0 { directory } [ Directory (computing) ] into a { directory } [ Directory (computing) ] in your { openvpn } [ OpenVpn ] installation.N.B. You can copy lines of text using right-click and then when you right click inside the { PuTTY } [ PuTTY ] window it should paste, saving you a lot of typing. Be aware though, some formatting errors can occur when copying and pasting large blocks of text so if you do not get the result you are expecting, resort to typing the details in by hand.Next type:cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsaThis changes the directory your command prompt sits at to your openvpn/easy-rsa directory.You now need to edit the text in the file we just copied over. Nano is a simple { text editor } [ Text editor ] in { Raspbian } [ Raspbian ] you are going to see a lot of over the next few pages. To open the file inside this text editor type:nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/varsIn the text that opens find the line that begins: export EASY_RSA=You need to move the cursor down to edit this line to read:export EASY_RSA=\"/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa\"N.B. Make sure you remove any extraneous speech marks as anything other than the exact text above here will stop your keys from saving in the right place.Next move your cursor down until you see the line: export KEY_SIZE=1024If you want to be extra secure you can change the value here to 2048 bit encryption, although the key you eventually build will take significantly longer to generate. If you choose to do this edit that line to read:export KEY_SIZE=2048Keep scrolling to the end of the file and you will see a bunch of export parameters such as { Country } [ Country ], { Province } [ Province ] and { City } [ City ] etc. You can choose to change these to set new defaults (this will potentially save you some typing in various later stages), but doing so will not affect the workings of your VPN.Type { CTRL } [ CTRL ] and { X } [ X Window System ] then { Y } [ Y Window System ] then { ENTER } [ Enter (Unix) ] to save this file.Build your { certificates } [ Public key certificate ]You are now set up to build the { certificates } [ Public key certificate ] your { VPN } [ Virtual private network ] will use to grant authority to devices you want to connect with. To open the easy-rsa directory, at the command prompt type:cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsaNext type:source ./varsThis loads the vars document you edited earlier.Next type:./clean-allThis will remove any previous keys in the system.Next type:. The { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] will now ask you to complete some additional export values, like { Country } [ Country ], { Province } [ Province ], { City } [ City ], Organisation etc. (if you changed these in the previous stage you will see your own choices already set as default).It is not necessary for these values to be accurate so just hit Enter each instance to use default value if you are feeling slack.Name the { server } [ Server (computing) ]Once you have entered through the fields and returned to the command prompt you need to name your { server } [ Server (computing) ] {. } [ .exe ] Call it whatever you like but do not forget it.Type:./build-key-server ServerName\u2026 replacing ServerName with your choice of name.You will now be given some more fields to enter values. You can change these or leave them as the defaults, but pay attention to three fields:Common Name MUST be the server name you picked.A challenge { password } [ Password ]? MUST be left blank.Sign the { certificate } [ Certificate ]? y/n Obviously, you must type \"y.\"Finally when prompted with the question:1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? y/nType \"y\"Build keys for each userYour server is now set up and you need to build keys for all the devices you want to be able to connect.You can cut corners here and just build one key to use on all devices. Only one device can connect using each { key } [ Key (cryptography) ] at a time though, so if you want simultaneous connections you will need a different { key } [ Key (cryptography) ] for each one.To assign a { user } [ User (computing) ] a { key } [ Key (cryptography) ] type:./build-key-pass UserName\u2026 substituting the UserName with your desired text - for example to make a key to connect my android to the { VPN } [ Virtual private network ] I chose the name KateAndroidYou will get some more prompts now:Enter PEM pass phrase\u2026 choose a password you will remember! It asks you to input this twice to eliminate errors.A challenge { password } [ Password ]?

This means the { server } [ Server (computing) ] will not try to authenticate an access request if it does not detect this { key } [ Key (cryptography) ]. To generate the static { HMAC } [ HMAC ] key type:openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.keyN.B.

Each time you { reboot } [ Reboot ] your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] you will need to relaunch { PuTTY } [ PuTTY ] to connect to it.Ensure you have a static public { IP address } [ IP address ]We have created locks and keys for devices to use to connect to your { VPN } [ Virtual private network ], but before we hand those keys out we need to tell them where to find the front door. This is your public { IP address } [ IP address ], which should be kept a secret as it identifies your location on the { internet } [ World Wide Web ]. Just type \"what's my { IP address } [ IP address ]?\" into the search box.If this address changes each time you log on you do not have a static { IP address } [ IP address ] so will need to use a dynamic domain name system (DDNS) service to give yourself a { domain name } [ Domain name ] to put in place of the { IP address } [ IP address ].There is a free service at https://www.changeip.com Then on your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ], you need to run something called DDclient to update your { DDNS } [ DDNS ] registry automatically.At the command prompt type:sudo apt-get install ddclientThis will launch a wizard for configuring ddclient. Don't worry too much about what you enter here as we will be entering the config file straight away.To edit the DDClient configuration with the correct setting type:sudo nano /etc/ddclient.confEvery { service } [ Service (systems architecture) ] will have slightly different { configuration } [ Computer configuration ], - if you are using changeip.com this { blog } [ Blog ] post will tell you how to edit your settings successfully https://blogdotmegajasondotcom.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/use-ddclient-with-changeip-com/CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save.Finally, to set this { program } [ Computer program ] running type:sudo ddclientN.B. If you reboot your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] you'll need to type \"sudo ddclient\" to start running it again.Create profile scripts for the devices you want to connectWe have created keys for clients (computers and devices) to use to connect to your { VPN } [ Virtual private network ], but we have not told the clients where to find the server, how to connect, or which key to use.If you created several different { client } [ Client (computing) ] keys for each of the devices you want to grant access, it would be a lot of trouble to generate a new { configuration file } [ Configuration file ] for each { client } [ Client (computing) ] from scratch.Luckily Eric Jodoin of the { SANS } [ SANS Institute ] institute has written a script to generate them automatically.First type:sudo nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/Default.txtFill in the blank text file with the following:clientdev tunproto udpremote YOUR PUBLIC IP ADDRESS 1194  #REPLACE YOUR DYNAMIC DNS VALUE FROM CHANGEIP.COMresolv-retry infinitenobindpersist-keypersist-tunmute-replay-warningsns-cert-type serverkey-direction 1cipher AES-128-CBCcomp-lzoverb 1mute 20CTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save.Next, to create the script that makes your profile keys type:nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/MakeOVPN.txt\"FILEEXT=\".ovpn\"CRT=\".crt\"KEY=\".3des.key\"CA=\"ca.crt\"TA=\"ta.key\"#Ask for a Client nameecho \"Please enter an existing Client Name:\"read NAME#1st Verify that client's Public Key Existsif  ! -f $NAME$CRT ; thenecho \"ERROR: Client Public Key Certificate not found: $NAME$CRT\"exitfiecho \"Client's cert found: $NAME$CR\"#Then, verify that there is a private key for that clientif  ! -f $NAME$KEY ; thenecho \"ERROR: Client 3des Private Key not found: $NAME$KEY\"exitfiecho \"Client's Private Key found: $NAME$KEY\"#Confirm the { CA } [ CA Technologies ] public key existsif  ! -f $CA ; thenecho \"ERROR: { CA } [ CA Technologies ] Public Key not found: $CA\"exitfiecho \" {CA } [ CA Technologies ] public Key found: $CA\"#Confirm the tls-auth ta key file existsif  ! -f $TA ; thenecho \"ERROR: tls-auth Key not found: $TA\"exitfiecho \"tls-auth Private Key found: $TA\"#Ready to make a new .\"#Script written by Eric Jodoin\\ No newline at end of fileCTRL and X then Y and ENTER to save.N.B. { I } [ I (1996 film) ] was not able to successfully copy and paste the entire script accurately in one go, but taking it one section at a time worked no problem).Next you need to give this { script } [ Scripting language ] permission to run. Type:cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/The to give it root privileges type:chmod 700 MakeOVPN.shFinally, execute the { script } [ Scripting language ] with:./MakeOVPN.shAs it runs, it will ask you to input the usernames names of the { clients } [ Client (computing) ] for you generated keys for earlier (in my case KateAndroid). Type that when prompted and you should see the line:Done! KateAndroid.ovpn Successfully Created.Repeat this step for each additional username you added client.Export your client { keys } [ Key (cryptography) ] for use on the connecting devicesYou now need to copy those { keys } [ Key (cryptography) ] onto the devices you want to use them. If you are using { PuTTY } [ PuTTY ] on a { Windows } [ Microsoft Windows ] machine you can use a software package called WinSCP to do this.First, to grant yourself read/write access to the folder at the command prompt type:chmod 777 /etc/openvpnchmod 777 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsachmod 777 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keyschmod 777 /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ClientName.ovpnBe sure to undo this when you're done copying files by typing: {chmod } [ Chmod ] 600 /etc/openvpnand repeating for each step with the { chmod } [ Chmod ] 600 command, which removes read/write access again.You can now launch the software you are using to copy the files off your { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ] to navigate to the openvpn folder and copy the files labelled \"KateAndroid.ovpn\" etc.You can also open the command prompt on the machine in your network you would like to copy the files to and type:scp pi@ip-address-of-your-pi:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ClientName.ovpn ClientName.ovpnInstall the OpenVPN Connect app on your deviceYou are now ready to download and install the OpenVPN Connect app on your { Android } [ Android (operating system) ] or { iPhone } [ IPhone ] - they are available through the stores as a free download. You will need to import the profile keys you just made as the final piece of the { VPN } [ Virtual private network ] connection puzzle.When prompted for a pass phrase here it is the 3des.key one you will need to enter.For { iOS } [ IOS ]Use { iTunes } [ ITunes ] to add the .ovpn file to the OpenVPN Connect app. When you launch the { app } [ Mobile app ] on your { phone } [ Mobile phone ] you will now get the option of installing that profile and making the connection.For AndroidConnect your { android } [ Android (operating system) ] device to your computer with a { USB } [ USB ] cable. Navigate to the Downloads folder on your { handset } [ Handset ] and paste the .ovpn file there.When you launch the app on your handset you can now tap the menu dropdown in the top right corner, select Import>Import profile from { SD } [ SD card ] card then navigate to the downloads folder and choose to import the file and make the connection.One more thingAfter all this is done, if your phone still can't connect to the { OpenVPN } [ OpenVPN ] server you might need to adjust the firewall on your router to do port-forwarding of port 1194 to the { Raspberry Pi } [ Raspberry Pi ]. You'll need to follow the instructions from your { ISP } [ Internet service provider ] to access the { router } [ Router (computing) ] and complete this step.THANKS TO : https://twitter.com/zoodor for debugging this guide."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170811005522/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36201676": "Having slapped on his sun hat and dusted down his tux, the { BBC } [ BBC ] {'s } [ BBC ] { Neil Smith } [ Neil Smith (journalist) ] is on the Croisette to bring you all the news, gossip and glamour from this annual cinema showcase.Follow his adventures here and on the entertainment news team's { Twitter } [ Twitter ] feed.That's all from my { Cannes } [ Cannes ] diary this year, but we'll have plenty more news and features to bring you from the festival before it comes to a close this weekend.I'll leave you with my favourite poster from the Marche du Film, the bustling film market in which any film idea, however fanciful, can apparently be sold to someone.Bonne projection!Expectations had been running high ahead of this morning's press screening of { Loving } [ Loving (1996 film) ], { Jeff Nichols } [ Jeff Nichols ]' film about an interracial couple from { Virginia } [ Virginia ] who faced prison in the '50s for getting married.The story is one that could have generated any number of stirring { courtroom } [ Courtroom ] declarations, triumphant exclamations of victory and other such { clich\u00e9s } [ Clich\u00e9 ].Yet Nichols - whose previous features include the highly regarded { Mud } [ Mud (film) ], { Take Shelter } [ Take Shelter ] and { Midnight Special } [ Midnight Special (film) ] - takes a different tack, concentrating on the human struggle behind the headlines.He is aided by { Joel Edgerton } [ Joel Edgerton ] and { Ruth Negga } [ Ruth Negga ], both of whom give movingly understated performances as the couple whose surname gives the film its title, as well as a cameo from his regular collaborator { Michael Shannon } [ Michael Shannon ].Loving is a well-made, well-told and well-timed film from a director we'll all be hearing a lot more of in future.(Pun alert)The Palm Dog is a charming { Cannes } [ Cannes ] tradition in which awards are presented each year to the festival's best canine performances.The { prizes } [ Prize ] are given out at the end of the { event } [ Tournament ].Say hi to Nellie, a slobbery { English } [ England ] bulldog whose portrayal of { Marvin } [ Marvin the Paranoid Dog ] in the new film from { Jim Jarmusch } [ Jim Jarmusch ] could well see this dog have its day.Said mutt steals all the \"paw-dits\" in { Paterson } [ Paterson, New Jersey ], a low-key character study that takes its name both from its main (human) character and the city where he resides.The film chronicles a week in the life of Paterson ( {Adam Driver } [ Adam Driver ]), a { New Jersey } [ New Jersey ] bus driver who has a secret life as a { poet } [ Poet ].Every day he gets up {, } [ P. G. Wodehouse ] kisses his { wife } [ Wife ] and goes to { work } [ Employment ] {. } [ P. G. Wodehouse ]The { film } [ Film ] is about the people he encounters, the conversations he overhears and the { poems } [ Poetry ] he never lets anyone read.Paterson is up for the { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ] but is probably too minimalist and uneventful to walk away with the accolade.If { Marvin } [ Marvin the Paranoid Android ] isn't recognised at the Palm Dogs, though, it will be \"ruff justice\" indeed.Remember that open-air screening of { Prince } [ Prince (musician) ] film { Purple Rain } [ Purple Rain (film) ] that had to be called off on Thursday due to inclement weather?Well, it had been thought the { festival } [ Festival ] would try to show the film again on Sunday at its { cinema } [ Movie theater ] on the beach.For reasons best known to { Cannes } [ Cannes ] director { Thierry Fremaux } [ Thierry Fremaux ], though, there was no { Prince } [ Prince (musician) ] to be seen last night.Instead, the festival chose to project 1966 { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ] recipient { A Man and a Woman } [ A Man and a Woman ] - a great film to be sure, but a lost opportunity all the same.The upshot is where the { Berlin Film Festival } [ Berlin International Film Festival ] had the opportunity to honour { David Bowie } [ David Bowie ], a chance to celebrate His Royal Funkiness was allowed to slip through { Cannes } [ Cannes ]' fingers.Russell { Crowe } [ Russell Crowe ] and { Ryan Gosling } [ Ryan Gosling ] had a fine old time at the Nice Guys press conference, clowning for the cameras and responding to questions with a string of wisecracks.Crowe started off by using his { mobile phone } [ Mobile phone ] to take a picture of his co-star, much to the latter's mock displeasure.Here are some of other light-hearted moments from this afternoon's event:\u2022 Asked if he had ever used the { Stanislavsky } [ Konstantin Stanislavski ] acting method, { Crowe } [ Russell Crowe ] said he used \"the { Russell Crowe } [ Russell Crowe ] method\". \"I have no expletive idea what the { Stanislavsky } [ Konstantin Stanislavski ] method may be,\" he continued {The Nice Guys } [ The Nice Guys ] is released in the { US } [ United States ] on Friday and in the { UK } [ United

Shane Black } [ Shane Black ] that's screening this weekend out of competition.They're thrown together in 1970s { Los Angeles } [ Los Angeles ] when they find themselves looking for the same girl, a politician's daughter caught in a conspiracy involving { pollution } [ Pollution ], { pornography } [ Pornography ] and corporate malfeasance.Gosling displays great comic chops as a mustachioed buffoon who's always messing up, much to the dismay of his own teenage daughter.To my mind, though, there's nothing particularly nice about the film's endless profanity, cartoonish violence and depiction of women as disposable sex objects.Crowe and Gosling will be fielding questions from the press this afternoon, so stop back in a little while to find out what they said.There's more { Shia LaBeouf } [ Shia LaBeouf ] - a lot more in fact - in { American Honey } [ American Honey (film) ], the fourth feature from { British } [ United Kingdom ] director { Andrea Arnold } [ Andrea Arnold ].A road movie set in the { US Midwest } [ Midwestern United States ], it's one of only two UK titles in the main { Cannes } [ Cannes ] competition, the other being { Ken Loach } [ Ken Loach ]'s { I, Daniel Blake } [ I, Daniel Blake ].The similarities don't end there, as both films have the same { cinematographer } [ Cinematographer ] in { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ]'s { Robbie Ryan } [ Robbie Ryan (cinematographer) ] {. } [ Robbie Ryan (cinematographer) ]Yet his work on each film could hardly be more different, the unadorned naturalism of { I } [ I, Daniel Blake ] {, Daniel Blake } [ I, Daniel Blake ] being a world away from { Honey } [ Honey (band) ] {'s } [ Honey (band) ] radiant, sun-soaked visuals.Arnold's film tells of a teenaged girl from a troubled home who has a life-changing { rite of passage } [ Rite of passage ] when she runs away with a travelling sales crew who sell { magazine } [ Magazine ] subscriptions door to door.Along the way she falls for her recruiter (LaBeouf), a fast-talking opportunist who will use any means necessary to make his sales quota.Like a number of the titles I've seen this year, though, it might have benefited from being just a little shorter.What with { The BFG } [ The BFG ] and all, Saturday was quite a busy day.Here are a few of the other things I got up to over the last 24 hours.Chat to { Andy Serkis } [ Andy Serkis ] {. } [ Andy Serkis ]The { Lord of the Rings } [ The Lord of the Rings ] star was at a morning event hosted by our { BBC Films } [ BBC Films ] colleagues to talk about Breathe, his next foray

about his rivalry with { John McEnroe } [ John McEnroe ].Shia LaBeouf will play { McEnroe } [ James McEnroe ] in the tennis-based drama, which will focus on the run-up to the 1980 { Wimbledon } [ The Championships, Wimbledon ] Final and co-star { Stellan Skarsgard } [ Stellan Skarsgard ] as { Borg } [ James Borg ]'s coach.New balls, please.The biggest smile at today's press conference for { The BFG } [ The BFG ] came from { Ruby Barnhill } [ Ruby Barnhill ], the young actress chosen to play the female lead in { Steven Spielberg } [ Steven Spielberg ]'s { Roald Dahl } [ Roald Dahl ] adaption.\"It's amazing to know you've been cast in such an incredible and magical film,\" the 11-year-old beamed.\"It's a dream come true and it's so incredible to be in { Cannes } [ Cannes

].\"This is one movie you do not want to cast { American } [ United States ] actors in,\" joked { Spielberg } [ Steven Spielberg ], adding that he had imagined the grilling he would have faced in { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] had he gone down that route.In one scene in the film, Wilton's Queen drinks a magical { libation } [ Libation ] that makes her (and her { corgis } [ Corn dog ]) excessively { flatulent } [ Flatulence ] {. } [ Flatulence ]The { Downton Abbey } [ Downton Abbey ] star suggested it was amusing to see the { Queen } [ Elizabeth II ] placed in unfamiliar situations, while suggesting her \"wonderful sense of humour\" would allow her to see the funny side.A more sombre note was struck by one { journalist } [ Journalist ], who asked { Spielberg } [ Steven Spielberg ] where movies like his fitted in a world full of { homelessness } [ Homelessness ] and { inequality } [ Social inequality ]. \"The worse the { world } [ World ] gets, the more { magic } [ Magic (supernatural) ] we have to believe in.\"That { magic } [ Magic (supernatural) ] will give us { hope } [ Hope ], and that { hope } [ Hope ] will cause us to be proactive in a world that needs our attention more than it ever has.\" {The BFG } [ The BFG (novel) ] is out in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] later this year.The sun came out for { Steven Spielberg } [ Steven Spielberg ] for the { Cannes } [ Cannes ] premiere of { The BFG } [ The BFG (1996 film) ], his big-screen version of { Roald Dahl } [ Roald Dahl ]'s much-loved story about the Big Friendly Giant and the little girl who befriends him.Like 1982's { ET } [ ET (film) ] before it, the film tells of a bond between a human child and an other-worldly being - in this case a { giant } [ Giant ] who comes out at night to harvest and distribute dreams.Written by the same person who penned { ET } [ ET (character) ], the late { Melissa Mathison } [ Melissa Mathison ], { Spielberg } [ Steven Spielberg ]'s latest whisks the audience away to a magnificently realised Giant Country, where the { BFG } [ The BFG ] - played by { Mark Rylance } [ Mark Rylance ] through a combination of motion capture and special effects - is himself dwarfed by giants of a far less amicable temperament.When the nasty giants endanger the human realm, young heroine Sophie - a character named after { Dahl } [ Dahl ]'s first granddaughter - enlists the aid of Her Majester the Queenie ( {Penelope Wilton } [ Penelope Wilton ]), leading to a visit by { the BFG } [ The BFG ] to { Buckingham Palace } [ Buckingham Palace ] that is the film's stand-out comic set-piece.Though occasionally as ponderous as { Rylance } [ Rylance ] {'s } [ Rylance ] delivery of his giant's malapropism-laden dialogue, { The BFG } [ The BFG ] is a charmer that will entrance children around the world.If the film received a slightly muted response at today's press screening, it might be down to { Dahl } [ Dahl ]'s fondness for the made-up word - a penchant that necessitates the inclusion of a { glossary } [ Glossary ] in the movie's accompanying press material.You have to feel for the poor subtitle writers who had to find a { French } [ France ] equivalent for \"delumptious\", \"frobscottle\" and \"telly-telly bunkum box\".We'll have more from { Spielberg } [ Steven Spielberg ] and { Rylance } [ Lance Rylance ] later, so stay tuned.Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of { Johnny Depp } [ Johnny Depp ] and his former partner { Vanessa Paradis } [ Vanessa Paradis ], was cheered on by her mother last night at the premiere of a film in which she has a starring role.Lily-Rose, 16, appears in { The Dancer } [ The Dancer (1927 film) ] as { Isadora Duncan } [ Isadora Duncan ], the celebrated performer who died so tragically, not very far from here, in 1927.The Dancer, though, catches Duncan at the start of her ascent, when she was taken under the wing of one Loie Fuller in 1900s { Paris } [ Paris ].Born in the { American } [ United States ] { Midwest } [ Midwestern United States ], Fuller enjoyed remarkable if now largely forgotten success with a \"serpentine dance\" that saw her create exotic, butterfly-like shapes on stage from inside a flowing silk gown.Fuller's career, slightly fictionalised, is the true subject of { Stephanie Di Giusto } [ Stephanie Di Giusto ]'s film, an elegant if conventional { biopic } [ Biographical film ] that could have used some of the daring seen in the aforementioned { Neruda } [ Neruda (film) ].Kudos, though, to { singer } [ Singing ] turned { actress } [ Actor ] { Soko } [ Soko (singer) ] - real name Stephanie Sokolinski - for the intensity and commitment with which she brings { Fuller } [ Stephanie Fuller ] back to life.The { Dancer } [ The Dancer (2012 film) ], which screened in { Cannes } [ Cannes ] under the { Un Certain Regard } [ Un Certain Regard ] banner, will receive a full { French } [ France ] release in September.It was a good story. No, it was a great story. Sadly, it doesn't appear to be a totally TRUE story.Unfortunately, no one appeared to have mentioned this to { Gaga } [ Lady Gaga ] herself, whose involvement in the project has since been denied by her { publicist } [ Publicist ] {. } [ Publicist ]Surprise, surprise indeed.Ken { Loach } [ Ken Loach ] {'s } [ Ken Loach ] latest film is in the main competition line-up, so it has a chance of winning the prestigious { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ] award.But there are many different sections and sidebars in { Cannes } [ Cannes ] that go beyond the 21 films in contention for its main prizes.Caf\u00e9 Society and Money Monster, for example, played out of competition, meaning they got lots of publicity without having to face scrutiny from a jury.( {Julia Roberts } [ Julia Roberts ] certainly helped that last night by climbing the steps of the Grand Theatre Lumiere barefoot - interpreted by many as a statement in the light of reports that women were turned away from premieres last year for not wearing heels.)Then there are the films in the { Un Certain Regard } [ Un Certain Regard ] sidebar, not to mention those picked to appear under the { Directors' Fortnight } [ Directors' Fortnight ] and { International Critics' Week } [ International Critics' Week ] banners.After that you have the special screenings, the midnight screenings, and the so-called Cannes Classics.And beyond those there is the Marche du Film, a bustling shop window for films both finished and in the pipeline that holds its own slew of screenings at various locales across town.What this means is that no one at the { festival } [ Festival ] will ever see everything they would like or intend to see.So a lot of times you end up going with your gut - which is what I did this morning when I went to see { Neruda } [ Neruda (film) ], one of the films in the { Directors' Fortnight } [ Directors' Fortnight ] section.The good news for me is that my gamble paid off, { Pablo Larrain } [ Pablo Larrain ]'s biopic of the { Chilean } [ Chile ] politician and poet { Pablo Neruda } [ Pablo Neruda ] proving witty, intelligent and seductive.I'm no expert when it comes to { Neruda } [ Pablo Neruda ]'s { poetry } [ Poetry ], but I certainly intend to become better informed once the { festival } [ Festival ] is over.Part of what makes the film interesting is its approach to its subject, seen here in the late 1940s when his { communist } [ Communism ] sympathies saw him ostracised and persecuted by the { Chilean } [ Chile ] authorities.They're represented here by a dogged yet incompetent policeman, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who becomes obsessed with { Neruda } [ Pablo Neruda ] to the point of distraction.Throw in cameos from { Pablo Picasso } [ Pablo Picasso ] and { Augusto Pinochet } [ Augusto Pinochet ] and you have an unusual and unconventional portrait of an artist.I hope to be making many more such discoveries as the festival continues.\"Wow!\" muttered { Ken Loach } [ Ken Loach ] this lunchtime as his arrival at the official { press conference } [ News conference ] for his latest { film } [ Film ] was met with a sustained round of applause.I, Daniel Blake, his new feature, had clearly struck a chord with its depiction of a { Geordie } [ Geordie ] carpenter who finds himself on the breadline after suffering a { heart attack } [ Myocardial infarction ].Loach said it was \"shocking\" that, 50 years on from his seminal TV drama { Cathy Come Home } [ Cathy Come Home ], there were still stories of { social inequality } [ Social inequality ] and { injustice } [ Injustice ] waiting to be told.\"There is a conscious cruelty in the way we're organising our lives,\" he told reporters on Friday.\"The most vulnerable people in society are being told their { poverty } [ Poverty ] is their own fault.\"Writer { Paul Laverty } [ Paul Laverty ] went further, suggesting there was a \"propaganda campaign\" at work \"to denigrate everyone on welfare.\"\"There's nothing accidental about it, and it's affecting a huge section of the population.\" {Loach } [ Brian Loach ] also brushed off a suggestion that his latest { film } [ Film ] might be his swansong, muttering: \"I don't know about that.\" {Dionne Warwick } [ Dionne Warwick ] wafted into { Cannes } [ Cannes ] this morning to announce a { film } [ Film ] is to be made about her life.LeToya Luckett, an original member of { Destiny's Child } [ Destiny's Child ], will play the singer in Dionne in which { Lady Gaga } [ Lady Gaga ] will also appear as { Cilla Black } [ Cilla Black ]. {Danny Glover } [ Danny Glover ] will lay { Dionne Warwick } [ Dionne Warwick ] {'s } [ Dionne Warwick ] father in the { film } [ Film ]. Mario von Peebles is in talks to direct.Oscar winner { Olympia Dukakis } [ Olympia Dukakis ] is also lined up to appear as { Marlene Dietrich } [ Marlene Dietrich ], whose mentoring of { Warwick } [ Warwick (film) ] earned her the nickname \"Momma\".The film will be based on { Warwick } [ Warwick (film) ]'s own { autobiography } [ Autobiography ], entitled My Life, As I See It.Prince fans were left disappointed last night when an open-air tribute screening of the late { pop } [ Pop music ] star's 1984 film { Purple Rain } [ Purple Rain (film) ] was called off at short notice.High winds prevented the public screening going ahead on the beach - though it is hoped a second showing on Sunday will have a happier outcome.It's the kind of thing that happens at { Cannes } [ Cannes ], a place where plans can change at the drop of a sun hat and one never quite knows who one is going to bump into next.While entering a hotel on Thursday, for example, I found myself just one revolving glass pane away from { Mads Mikkelsen } [ Mads Mikkelsen ], { Danish } [ Denmark ] star of { Casino Royale } [ Casino Royale (2006 film) ] and { Hannibal } [ Hannibal (TV series) ] and a member of this year's { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ] jury.One { celebrity } [ Celebrity ] encounter I missed out on last night was with { Kendall Jenner } [ Kendall Jenner ], one of those { Kardashians } [ Kardashian ] we're all supposed to be keeping up with.Now that's what I called a missed opportunity. I would have dearly loved to have known what she made of the opening night film in this years' { Directors' Fortnight } [ Directors' Fortnight ].I, Daniel Blake, the new film from { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { Ken Loach } [ Ken Loach ], is an angry howl at the welfare system and the bureaucracy involved in obtaining benefits payments.Its titular hero - amusingly and touchingly played by stand-up comic { Dave Johns } [ Dave Johns ] - is a skilled { joiner } [ Joiner ] with a heart condition who has been signed off work by his doctor but who is still deemed fit to work by the Department of Work and Pensions.Cast adrift in a sea of red tape, { food banks } [ Food bank ] and forms that can only be filled out online, this 59-year-old { Geordie } [ Geordie ] finds both { poverty } [ Poverty ] and desperation knocking at his door.His plight is mirrored by that of Katie (pictured), a single mother from { London } [ London ] with her own battles against a system that is baldly depicted as insensitive, unhelpful and often openly hostile.There are clear links here to { Cathy Come Home } [ Cathy Come Home ], { Loach } [ Roger Loach ]'s influential 1966 TV play about another mother who falls on hard times.Half a century on, { I } [ I, Daniel Blake ] {, Daniel Blake } [ I, Daniel Blake ] shows the 79-year-old { director } [ Film director ] {'s } [ I, Daniel Blake ] eye for social injustice is as acute and unblinking as ever.Interestingly, the film's press screening this afternoon came with two sets of subtitles - { French } [ French language ] and { English } [ English language ].Were festival organisers fearful that the film's thick { Newcastle } [ Newcastle upon Tyne ] accents would be hard to make out? {George Clooney } [ George Clooney ], { Julia Roberts } [ Julia Roberts ] and { Jodie Foster } [ Jodie Foster ] make a stellar trio in anyone's book.Small wonder they've been invited to { Cannes } [ Cannes ] to bring some more { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ] glamour - oh, and a { film } [ Film ] - to this year's event.The film is called Money Monster, a satire-cum-thriller in which a smart-aleck presenter of a financial-advice TV show, played by { Clooney } [ George Clooney ], gets his comeuppance live on air.It comes in the rather too topical form of a vengeful investor, played by { Britain } [ United Kingdom ]'s { Jack O'Connell } [ Jack O'Connell (actor) ], who hijacks the show at gunpoint and forces its host to don an explosive-laden vest.The show, of course, becomes an international talking point, for all the { New York Police Department } [ New York City Police Department ] {'s } [ New York City Police Department ] attempts to keep a lid on the situation.Things get a lot sillier from there, though { Jodie Foster } [ Jodie Foster ] - directing here rather than starring - deserves some credit for keeping so many balls in the air at once.Clooney, alas, isn't really in his element as a flamboyant { TV } [ Television ] star whose thirst for ratings makes him behave more akin to a { circus } [ Circus ] ringmaster.Ofcom, meanwhile, would have a field day with the number of F-words that go out unbleeped. Haven't they heard of a 10-second delay? {Jesse Eisenberg } [ Jesse Eisenberg ] had only good things to say about the { London } [ London ] theatre scene this morning while doing the promotional rounds for { Woody Allen } [ Woody Allen ]'s Cafe Society.The { Batman v Superman } [ Batman v Superman (film) ] star is shortly to make his { West End } [ West End theatre ] debut in his own play The Spoils, which opens later this month at the { Trafalgar Studios } [ Trafalgar Studios ].\"I love theatre in { England } [ England ]; it's the most unusual theatre scene, even more unique than { New York } [ New York City ], because it has more interesting, government-funded shows.\"They're able to do bigger-budget, more obscure { theatre } [ Theatre ] than when it has to be independently produced and they have to get { stars } [ Movie star ] to be in it.\"I was very happy to hear they wanted to do my play; I would have done it anywhere.\"There had been talk ahead of this year's festival that security would be ramped up in the light of last year's attacks in { Paris } [ Paris ] and fears that { Cannes } [ Cannes ] too might be targeted.Apart from being subjected to the occasional sweep with a hand-held { metal detector } [ Metal detector ], though, I haven't noticed any particular escalation in the usual building entry procedures.The { festival } [ Festival ]'s first day was dampened somewhat by a heavy shower that had people on the Croisette scurrying for shelter.But it didn't stop the opening night { ceremony } [ Olympic Games ceremony ] going ahead as scheduled, as these photos from the { red carpet } [ Red carpet ] show.\"Life isn't all { cupcakes } [ Cupcake ] and { rainbows } [ Rainbow ], you know.\"No, not { Woody Allen } [ Woody Allen ] again, but { Justin Timberlake } [ Justin Timberlake ] in his latest role as a glum troll named Branch in the latest animation from the { DreamWorks } [ DreamWorks Animation ] stable.Called Trolls, the film tells of a cheerful little creature called Poppy ( {Anna Kendrick } [ Anna Kendrick ]) who spends her days singing, laughing and hugging the other denizens of her magical, candy-coloured world.Until, that is, a nasty { ogre } [ Ogre ] makes off with some of her friends, forcing her to embark on a rescue mission with a reluctant { Branch } [ List of The Little Mermaid characters ] on tow.Festival attendees were given a preview earlier of some footage from the film, ahead of its release in the autumn.They were also given a treat: { Timberlake } [ Justin Timberlake ] and { Kendrick } [ Kendrick (singer) ] performing an acoustic version of { Cyndi Lauper } [ Cyndi Lauper ]'s { True Colours } [ True Colours (Cyndi Lauper song) ], one of the songs that appears in the film.Justin will be at the { Eurovision Song Contest } [ Eurovision Song Contest ] this weekend to sing { Can't Stop the Feeling } [ Can't Stop the Feeling ], another song from the { Trolls } [ Trolls (film) ] soundtrack.I guess we should consider this a warm-up.Woody Allen was on predictably mordant form at today's { Caf\u00e9 Society } [ Caf\u00e9 Society ] press conference, describing life as \"fraught with peril, sadness and cruelty\".\"You can look at life as amusing with a { farcical } [ Farce ] element to it,\" he told { journalists } [ Journalist ] {. } [ Journalist ] \"But it can also be very sad if you penetrate it.\"The veteran { director } [ Film director ] also had some slightly prescriptive words for { stars } [ Movie star ] who complain about press intrusion into their private lives.\" {Celebrities } [ Celebrity ] often kvetch about the lack of { privacy } [ Privacy ] and the { paparazzi } [ Paparazzi ] but these are not life-threatening problems,\" he went on.\"There are upsides and downsides to fame, but the perks outweigh the downsides.\"Caf\u00e9 Society, like several of Woody's films, involves a relationship between an older man and a younger woman - a recurring trope that a couple of (female) journalists gently took him to task about.Allen, though, said he \"wouldn't hesitate\" to write a { film } [ Film ] in which the ages were reversed, but said it was \"not a commonly seen thing\".\"It's a perfectly valid idea to have the age difference in that direction,\" he said as he sat on a dais between { Kristen Stewart } [ Kristen Stewart ], 26, and { Blake Lively } [ Blake Lively ], 28.\"I just don't have the { experience } [ Experience ] or the { material } [ Material ] to draw on.\"I'll be spending some more time with { Allen } [ Allen in Person ] and his cast tomorrow, so make sure you stop by. Caf\u00e9 Society is the 14th of his films to screen at the festival and the third one to launch it.A nostalgic throwback to the glamorous nightclubs and pool parties of 1930s { New York } [ New York City ] and { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ], it's a wistful story of thwarted romance that { Allen } [ Allen in film ] himself narrates.Its hero is Bobby Dorfman ( {Jesse Eisenberg } [ Jesse Eisenberg ]), a na\u00efve rube from the { Bronx } [ The Bronx ] who travels to { Los Angeles } [ Los Angeles ] in the hope of getting a job from his hotshot agent uncle ( {Steve Carell } [ Steve Carell ]).He quickly falls in love with his { uncle } [ Uncle ] {'s } [ Uncle ] secretary ( {Kristen Stewart } [ Kristen Stewart ]), only to discover she has a boyfriend to whom she is devoted.Can Bobby win her heart? Or will 'Vonnie' - short for Veronica - choose to stay with her lover, even it means breaking up his marriage?It's one of several moral dilemmas Allen toys with in a film which has a central theme of how the choices we make shape, steer and, in some cases, cut short our lives.Sumptuously photographed by { Vittorio Storaro } [ Vittorio Storaro ], { Caf\u00e9 Society } [ Caf\u00e9 Society ] is a gentle, meandering tale that revels in { Manhattan } [ Manhattan ]'s after-hours world of cocktails and jazz bars.Curiously, though, it also contains isolated scenes of mob-related violence that one would more readily associate with { Martin Scorsese } [ Martin Scorsese ] than its 80-year-old director.I suspect the { Cannes } [ Cannes ] critics will be perplexed by a picture that, like a lot of Allen's recent work, falls somewhere between playful { comedy } [ Comedy ] and thoughtful { drama } [ Drama ].But I'm sure they'll laugh as heartily as I did when one character remarks that one should \"live every day as if it's your last - because some day, you'll be right\".Caf\u00e9 Society will open the { Cannes Film Festival } [ Cannes Film Festival ] later and is out in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] in September."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170717171123/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/26548431": "Sussex and { Middlesex } [ Middlesex County F.C. ] meet at { Hove } [ Hove ] in the only other top-flight fixture, as { Durham } [ Durham County Football Club ] wait to begin their defence of the title seven days later.Surrey meet { Glamorgan } [ Glamorgan County Cricket Club ] at { The Oval } [ The Oval ] in Division Two, with skipper { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith ] hoping to inspire a promotion charge.This summer, a new 50-over { One-Day Cup } [ One Day International ] replaces the 40-over competition.The { England and Wales Cricket Board } [ England and Wales Cricket Board ] hope to attract even larger attendances to the game's shortest format, which has now been rebranded as the { T20 Blast } [ Twenty20 Cup ] {. } [ Twenty20 ]In a change from last year, most { Championship } [ Championship ] games will start on { Sundays } [ Sunday ] instead of { Wednesdays } [ Wednesday ], with the majority of { T20 } [ Twenty20 ] group games on { Fridays } [ Friday ], beginning on 16 May.One-Day Cup group games will all take place between 26 July and 21 August, with quarter and semi-finals to follow ahead of the final at { Lord's } [ Lord's ] on 20 September.The { BBC } [ BBC ] will again have commentary on every day of every { county } [ County cricket ] match this summer, via the { BBC Sport } [ BBC Sport ] website.Captain: { Wayne Madsen } [ Wayne Madsen ]Overseas players: { Shivnarine Chanderpaul } [ Shivnarine Chanderpaul ] ( {West Indies } [ West Indies ]), { Marcus North } [ Marcus North ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ])How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D1: 8th (relegated), { YB40 } [ YB40 ]: 6th in group, { FL } [ County Cricket League ] t20: 5th in group.Season prospects: { Derbyshire } [ Derbyshire County Cricket Club ] impressed many last season in eventually putting up a brave fight against relegation. They certainly did enough to make sure they go into the new { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] campaign among the favourites for promotion from { Division Two } [ Football League Second Division ] {. } [ Liverpool F.C. ] New elite performance director { Graeme Welch } [ Graeme Welch ] has instilled a sense of commitment and professionalism in the squad, and { Derbyshire } [ Derbyshire County Cricket Club ] have also kept hold of their top performers from last year.One to watch: Undoubtedly the { captain } [ Captain (sports) ], and { talisman } [ Talisman ] {, } [ Wayne Madsen ] { Wayne Madsen } [ Wayne Madsen ]. Named { Championship } [ County Championship ] player of the season 12 months ago, and the first man to reach 1,000 runs, just keeping him around is a huge achievement. { Fitter } [ Machinist ] and better prepared than ever, expect him to continue that form.By BBC Radio Derby's Owen BradleyCaptain: { Paul Collingwood } [ Paul Collingwood ] (for { Championship } [ County Championship ]), { Mark Stoneman } [ Mark Stoneman ] (for One-Day Cup and T20 Blast)Overseas players: { John Hastings } [ John Hastings (cricketer) ] (Australia)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D1: winners, YB40: 4th in group, FL t20: quarter-finalists.Season prospects: { Durham } [ Durham County Cricket Club ] were seen by many as relegation certainties for { 2013 } [ 2013 FA Cup Final ] {. } [ 2013 FA Cup Final ] It was amazing then, that they won the title in fine style with a club-record 10 victories to boot. This summer is difficult to assess as the squad has been trimmed again for financial reasons and { Ben Stokes } [ Ben Stokes ], { Graham Onions } [ Graham Onions ] and { Scott Borthwick } [ Scott Borthwick ] could all be away at times on international duty. The signing of { Australian } [ Australia ] { all-rounder } [ All-rounder ] { John Hastings } [ John Hastings (cricketer) ] is an interesting one as they did not employ an overseas player last year. Is he a straight replacement for { Stokes } [ Chris Stokes ]? They could well miss the influence around the club of the likes of { Will Smith } [ Will Smith (cricketer) ], { Callum Thorp } [ Callum Thorp ] and { Dale Benkenstein } [ Dale Benkenstein ], but the young players who stepped in last year did an astounding job and will have more belief in themselves as a result.One to watch: There are so many exciting prospects, it is difficult to single any individual out, so take your pick from { Usman Arshad } [ Usman Arshad ], { Keaton Jennings } [ Keaton Jennings ], { Michael Richardson } [ Michael Richardson (footballer) ] or { Mark Wood } [ Mark Wood (footballer) ] as the young players hope to kick on further this season. { Mark Stoneman } [ Mark Stoneman ] will hope to build on a good { 2013 } [ 2013 in cricket ] with the bat, and there are not many better new-ball pairs than Onions and { Chris Rushworth } [ Chris Rushworth ].By BBC Newcastle's { Martin Emmerson } [ Martin Emmerson ]Captain: James FosterOverseas players: None signed so far.How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D2: 3rd, { YB40 } [ YB40 ]: 2nd in group, { FL t20 } [ Twenty20 ]: semi-finalists.Season prospects: Promotion from Division Two of the { County Championship } [ County Championship ] has been a priority for { Essex } [ Essex ] in the last two years, but they came up short on each occasion. Getting first { innings } [ Innings ] { runs } [ Run (cricket) ] on the board has become a common problem and the { batting } [ Batting (cricket) ] has looked frail. Last season's 20 all out in their second innings against { Lancashire } [ Lancashire County Cricket Club ] might have been a shock to many, but for regular { Essex } [ Essex County Cricket Club ] fans it had been coming. A repeat of last season's { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ] Finals Day appearance is a possibility and the return of { 50-over } [ Limited overs cricket ] cricket will reignite memories of years gone by when { Essex } [ Essex County Cricket Club ] were a dominant force in that format.One to watch: With his express pace, { Tymal Mills } [ Tymal Mills ] was mentioned as a possible addition to the { Ashes } [ The Ashes ] tour party during the winter. While his potential is undoubted, the youngster needs to work on his control and it will be interesting to see how a winter spent with the England Development Squad has benefitted him. His early season progress will be watched with great interest, although nailing down a regular place in the { Essex } [ Essex ] side will need to be his first target as pitches in April may not suit him.By BBC Essex's Glenn SpellerCaptain: { Mark Wallace } [ Mark Wallace (cricketer) ] (Championship and One-Day Cup), { Jim Allenby } [ Jim Allenby ] (T20 Blast)Overseas players: { Jacques Rudolph } [ Jacques Rudolph ] (South Africa)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D2: 8th, YB40: beaten finalists, FL t20: 3rd in group.Season prospects: It has been a close-season of change off the field, with former { Glamorgan } [ Glamorgan County Cricket Club ] captain { Hugh Morris } [ Hugh Morris ] installed as director of cricket and chief executive and { Toby Radford } [ Toby Radford ] taking over as head coach from { Australian } [ Australia ] { Matthew Mott } [ Matthew Mott ]. With the backbone of { Murray Goodwin } [ Murray Goodwin ], { Jim Allenby } [ Jim Allenby ] and seamer { Michael Hogan } [ Michael Hogan (cricketer) ] retained, the addition of former { South Africa } [ South Africa national cricket team ] Test batsman { Rudolph } [ Olaf Rudolph ] promises to add consistency at the top of the order. A first { Lord's } [ Lord's ] final in 13 seasons in the { YB40 } [ YB40 ] marked an improvement last season, but promotion to Division One of the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] is { Radford } [ Radford F.C. ]'s main aim.One to watch: The top order's inconsistency last season means the arrival of former { South Africa } [ South Africa national cricket team ] { Test } [ Test cricket ] opener { Jacques Rudolph } [ Jacques Rudolph ] is the source of much anticipation at the { Swalec Stadium } [ Swalec Stadium ]. Coach { Radford } [ Alan Radford ] has singled out { Rudolph } [ Paul Rudolph (cricketer) ] as a key player to provide runs and bring the benefit of his experience of 48 { Test matches } [ Test cricket ] and 45 { one-day internationals } [ One Day International ] to bear on the club's homegrown batsmen.By BBC Wales' Richard WilliamsCaptain: { Michael Klinger } [ Michael Klinger ]Overseas players: { Michael Klinger } [ Michael Klinger ] (Australia)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D2: 6th, YB40: 4th in group, { FL } [ Lancashire County Cricket Club ] t20: 6th in group.Season prospects: There was progress in the four-day game last season, as { Michael Klinger } [ Michael Klinger ] proved a success with the bat and impressed with his captaincy, and if { Gloucestershire } [ Gloucestershire County Cricket Club ] can make a sound start to the season they could be an outside bet for promotion. Much depends on the support { Klinger } [ Paul Klinger ] receives from his fellow batsmen, while on the bowling side a lot rests on the front-line attack remaining injury-free as { Will Gidman } [ Will Gidman ] and { Craig Miles } [ Craig Miles ] are up there with the best in Division Two. In the one-day game, the county were a massive disappointment last year, particularly in the T20 format, and must find greater consistency, but with the ground development coming along apace, there is more optimism in the club now than a year ago.One to watch: Young paceman { Craig Miles } [ Craig Miles ] impressed all those who saw him last year, particularly at the the start of the season. He picked up 43 { Championship } [ County Championship ] wickets but suffered towards the end of the summer as he was forced to bowl more often than the club would have liked due to injuries to his bowling colleagues. His contract ties him to the { county } [ County cricket ] until { 2017 } [ 2017 County Championship ] and if nurtured correctly he could be leading the attack for seasons to come.By { BBC Radio Gloucestershire } [ BBC Radio Gloucestershire ]'s { Bob Hunt } [ Bob Hunt (journalist) ]Captain: { Jimmy Adams } [ Jimmy Adams ] (for { Championship } [ County Championship ] and { One-Day Cup } [ ECB One-Day Cup ]), { James Vince } [ James Vince ] (for T20 Blast)Overseas players: { Kyle Abbott } [ Kyle Abbott ] ( {South Africa } [ South Africa ]); { Glenn Maxwell } [ Glenn Maxwell ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ], for { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ])How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D2: 4th, YB40: semi-finalists, FL t20: semi-finalists.Season prospects: To mount a push for promotion in the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] {, } [ Hampshire County Cricket Club ] { Hampshire } [ Hampshire County Cricket Club ] need their bowlers taking 50 wickets or more this season. The evergreen { James Tomlinson } [ James Tomlinson (cricketer) ] will be expected to match his 53 from last season, and if { David Balcombe } [ David Balcombe ] can return to the devastating form that saw him pick up 59 in 2012, then { Hampshire } [ Hampshire County Cricket Club ] should prove a match for any side in the division, especially as they can also call on { South African } [ South Africa ] pace bowler { Kyle Abbott } [ Kyle Abbott ] and { Matt Coles } [ Matt Coles (cricketer) ], who was signed at the back end of last season after claiming over 50 victims for { Kent } [ Kent County Cricket Club ] two summers ago.One to watch: { James Vince } [ James Vince ] passed 1,000 { Championship } [ County Championship ] runs for the first time last season, confirming the 23-year-old's undoubted natural stroke-making ability. A regular in { England Lions } [ England national football Lions ] squads, { Vince } [ Vince McMahon ] will look to push himself into contention for the senior side as the fallout from the winter continues.By BBC Radio Solent's Kevan JamesCaptain: Rob KeyOverseas players: { Doug Bollinger } [ Doug Bollinger ] (Australia)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D2: 7th, { YB40 } [ YB40 ]: 4th in group, { FL } [ Lancashire County Cricket Club ] t20: 5th in group. Fans have yearned for an overseas { fast } [ Pace bowling ] bowler for years, so the addition of { Doug Bollinger } [ Doug Bollinger ] for the entire campaign to lead the bowling unit is a huge fillip. And if { Daniel Bell-Drummond } [ Daniel Bell-Drummond ] and { Sam Northeast } [ Sam Northeast ] can turn their undoubted potential into 1,000 plus runs, and { Adam Riley } [ Adam Riley ] capably fills { James Tredwell } [ James Tredwell ]'s spinning shoes whilst he is on international duty, { Kent } [ Kent County Cricket Club ] could surprise other teams this season. { Rob Key } [ Rob Key ] {'s } [ Rob Key ] return as { captain } [ Captain (association football) ] will add much-needed stability and although expectations on his side are low {, } [ Rob Key ] the potential is there.One to watch: { Darren Stevens } [ Darren Stevens (footballer) ] ended 2013 fearing his career could be over with an anti-corruption tribunal hanging over him. Despite the uncertainty, he was still { Kent } [ Kent County Cricket Club ] {'s } [ Kent County Cricket Club ] leading run-scorer in all competitions, including an emotional 205 not out against { Lancashire } [ Lancashire County Cricket Club ], and this summer should see { Stevens } [ Chris Stevens (cricketer) ] like a man reborn, having been cleared of all charges. His swashbuckling batting will be feared in all forms of the game and his military medium-pacers are an underrated weapon.By { BBC Radio Kent } [ BBC Radio Kent ] {'s } [ BBC Radio Kent ] Ben CroucherCaptain: { Glen Chapple } [ Glen Chapple ]Overseas players: None signed so far.How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D2: winners (promoted), { YB40 } [ YB40 ]: 3rd in group, { FL t20 } [ Twenty20 ]: quarter-finalists. Their bowling attack, led by { Kyle Hogg } [ Kyle Hogg ], { Glen Chapple } [ Glen Chapple ] and { Simon Kerrigan } [ Simon Kerrigan ], is as good as anything in the top-flight, but the one slight concern is whether they can score enough runs, especially following the exit of { Simon Katich } [ Simon Katich ]. Ashwell Prince, in his final season before retiring, will be crucial and if { Lancashire } [ Lancashire County Cricket Club ] can make big scores, they could compete for the title. Since { Peter Moores } [ Peter Moores (cricketer) ] became coach in 2009, the only time they have finished outside the top four of their division was their relegation season of 2012, so they are used to challenging towards the top end of the table, and the arrival of { England } [ England ] limited-overs wicketkeeper { Jos Buttler } [ Jos Buttler ] should help them do so again.One to watch: { Luis Reece } [ Luis Reece ] was handed his { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] debut halfway through last season and averaged more than 55 from 10 matches to help the Red Rose to promotion. He looks an accomplished { batsman } [ Batting (cricket) ], with a calmness that you need to be a success at the top of the { order } [ Batting order (cricket) ], and he is brave as well. The one thing he needs to improve on, by his own admission, is turning big scores into hundreds.

There is hope that { Ramnaresh Sarwan } [ Ramnaresh Sarwan ], who played just five { Championship } [ County Championship ] matches in 2013, should be available for most, if not all, of the season, and in the considerable promise shown by { Ned Eckersley } [ Ned Eckersley ], who scored 1,302 first class and 386 one-day runs last season.  The bowling too appears to have a stronger core, with { Charlie Shreck } [ Charlie Shreck ], { Kent } [ Kent County Cricket Club ]'s leading Championship wicket-taker in 2012 and 2013, adding his experience to a youthful seam department, while off-spinner { Jigar Naik } [ Jigar Naik ] is fit again after two seasons truncated by injury, and is joined in the squad by { England } [ England ] Under-19 prospect { Rob Sayer } [ Rob Sayer ].One to watch: { Eckersley } [ Paul Eckersley ] performed superbly in adversity last season and after an injury-affected 2013, { Dan Redfern } [ Dan Redfern ], signed from { Derbyshire } [ Derbyshire County Cricket Club ], will be determined to build on the promise he showed in scoring 848 { first-class } [ First-class cricket ] runs in 2012.By { BBC Radio Leicester } [ BBC Radio Leicester ]'s Richard RaeCaptain: { Chris Rogers } [ Chris Rogers (cricketer) ] (for { Championship } [ County Championship ]), { Eoin Morgan } [ Eoin Morgan ] (for One-Day Cup and T20 Blast)Overseas players: { Chris Rogers } [ Chris Rogers (cricketer) ] (Australia)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D1: 5th, YB40: 3rd in group, FL t20: 4th in group.Season prospects: Although finishing lower in the { Championship } [ County Championship ] table than in the previous season, { Middlesex } [ Middlesex County Cricket Club ] feel that last year again marked a further improvement for the county, and they were more competitive in the limited-over competitions as well. This summer { Eoin Morgan } [ Eoin Morgan ] will captain the one-day side and the { Irishman } [ Republic of Ireland ] will also play a large part in the early stages of the { Championship } [ County Championship ] following his decision to forego the { Indian Premier League } [ Indian Premier League ], adding invaluable experience and expertise to the middle order. Steven Finn should also see a lot of action for { Middlesex } [ Middlesex County Cricket Club ] as he looks to rebuild his confidence and challenge for an { England } [ England ] place again. And if { Toby Roland-Jones } [ Toby Roland-Jones ] and { James Harris } [ James Harris (cricketer) ] can stay fit, then they have an attack, led by the ever-reliable { Tim Murtagh } [ Tim Murtagh ], capable of ending the county's long wait for the title. The key word for the { team } [ Team ], in all { competitions } [ Competition ], will be { consistency } [ Consistency ] {. } [ Consistency ]One to watch: Persistent niggles prevented { Toby Roland-Jones } [ Toby Roland-Jones ] showing his true worth last season and it was to the detriment of the team. Many eyes last season were on { James Harris } [ James Harris (cricketer) ] and he too will hope to prove why the entire county circuit wanted him upon his departure from { Glamorgan } [ Glamorgan County Cricket Club ] {. } [ Glamorgan County Cricket Club ] { Australian } [ Australia national cricket team ] fast bowler { Jackson Bird } [ Jackson Bird ] will not be coming to { Wantage Road } [ Wantage Road ] because of a back problem, one-day captain { Alex Wakely } [ Alex Wakely ] could miss the entire summer with an Achilles tendon injury and there are early-season fitness worries about several others players, including pivotal all-rounder { David Willey } [ David Willey (cricketer) ].  On the plus side, batsman { Rob Newton } [ Rob Newton ] is back in the reckoning after an injury-hit 2013, while left-arm spinner { Graeme White } [ Graeme White ] returns to the club where he began his { first-class } [ First-class cricket ] career after a spell at { Nottinghamshire } [ Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club ]. Both could have important roles to play for { Stephen Peters } [ Stephen Peters ]' side as they face their first { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] Division One campaign since { 2004 } [ 2004 in association football ].One to watch: { Wicketkeeper } [ Wicket-keeper ] batsman { Ben Duckett } [ Ben Duckett ] underlined his enormous promise during the winter with some eye-catching performances at the { Under-19 World Cup } [ Under-19 Cricket World Cup ], but is one of the { county } [ County cricket ]'s injury concerns. Seam bowling all-rounder { Ollie Stone } [ Ollie Stone ] is another talented youngster who could have plenty of work this year.Season prospects: { Nottinghamshire } [ Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club ] salvaged something from a disappointing 2013 campaign by winning their first one-day final for 24 years at { Lord's } [ Lord's ] last September. For a side bursting with seasoned internationals, their { Championship } [ County Championship ] form was poor, forcing director of cricket { Mick Newell } [ Mick Newell ] to re-assess their overseas player strategy and switch from his usual preference of an experienced { batsman } [ Batting (cricket) ]. With { Australia } [ Australia national cricket team ] pace bowler { Peter Siddle } [ Peter Siddle ] brought in instead to bolster the bowling unit, { Notts } [ Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club ] should be more competitive in four-day { cricket } [ Cricket ] and, with proven hitters at the top of the order, will always be competitive in the shorter formats. Expect at least one of the three trophies to be heading towards { Trent Bridge } [ Trent Bridge ].One to watch: It is not only { Nottinghamshire } [ Nottinghamshire ] supporters that are looking forward to seeing { Peter Siddle } [ Peter Siddle ] in { English } [ England ] domestic { cricket } [ Cricket ] for the first time. A proven competitor at the very highest level, he should relish the conditions in { England } [ England ] and is already an early tip to be leading wicket-taker in Division One.

Some brittle batting performances were the biggest problem last year, but a top order containing { Nick Compton } [ Nick Compton ], { Alviro Petersen } [ Alviro Petersen ], { Marcus Trescothick } [ Marcus Trescothick ], { James Hildreth } [ James Hildreth ] and { Craig Kieswetter } [ Craig Kieswetter ] should surely be able to provide more solid foundations. Having been one of the most consistent one-day teams in the country over the last five years, { Somerset } [ Somerset County Cricket Club ] should again be a force to be reckoned with, although the loss of { Jos Buttler } [ Jos Buttler ] is a real blow.One to watch: The only new face this summer is { South African } [ South Africa ] { Johann Myburgh } [ Johann Myburgh ] who should add more solidity to { Somerset } [ Somerset County Cricket Club ] {'s } [ Somerset County Cricket Club ] batting, as well as a useful spin option. But their success this { season } [ 2012\u201313 in English football ] is likely to revolve around how many of the { club } [ Football team ]'s talented youngsters can become real match-winners. If half of a group including { Craig } [ Craig Overton ] and { Jamie Overton } [ Jamie Overton ], { Lewis Gregory } [ Lewis Gregory ], { Craig Meschede } [ Craig Meschede ], { Alex Barrow } [ Alex Barrow ], { Chris Jones } [ Chris Jones (rugby league) ], { George Dockrell } [ George Dockrell ] and { Jack Leach } [ Jack Leach (rugby league) ] step up, they could be title challengers.By { BBC Radio Bristol } [ BBC Radio Bristol ] & { BBC Somerset } [ BBC Somerset ]'s Ed HadwinCaptain: { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith ]Overseas players: { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith ] (South Africa)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D1: 9th (relegated), YB40: 5th in group, FL t20: beaten finalists.Season prospects: { Surrey } [ Surrey Rugby Football Union ] head into the new season with bags of potential and a new regime under head coach { Graham Ford } [ Graham Ford ], while having { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith (rugby union) ] available for the whole season to lead the side is huge. Former { England } [ England cricket team ] batsman { Kevin Pietersen } [ Kevin Pietersen ] will also be available outside of his overseas { T20 } [ Twenty20 ] commitments. Promotion from the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] will be a target, but the management team will also be focusing on seeing improved performances from individuals and the team in the longer form of the game. There will be a more youthful look to the side and patience will be needed because the rate of improvement will differ among individuals. { Surrey } [ Surrey County Cricket Club ] will be confident of making an impact in the shorter forms of the game and it will be a fascinating season to see the progress that is made over the summer months.One to watch: { Jason Roy } [ Jason Roy ] possesses so much natural talent and can take an attack apart on his day. He has already shown what he can do in the shorter form of the game, but in the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] he is yet to reach his full potential. There is no reason why he cannot score a stack of { runs } [ Run (cricket) ] in the longer form of the game - two sessions of { Jason Roy } [ Jason Roy (cricketer) ] batting can turn a game on its head.9's { Mark Church } [ Mark Church (cricketer) ]Captain: { Ed Joyce } [ Ed Joyce ]Overseas players: { Steve Magoffin } [ Steve Magoffin ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ] {), Yasir Arafat } [ Yasir Arafat ] ( {Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] {, for T20 Blast } [ Twenty20 Cup ] {)How they did last season: County Championship D1: 3rd, YB40: 3rd in group, FL t20: 6th in group. } [ County Championship ]Season prospects: { Sussex } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] {'s } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] preparations for the new season have been hampered by injuries to key players. Opener { Chris Nash } [ Chris Nash (cricketer) ] is recovering from a burst appendix and is likely to be missing for several weeks, while { Luke Wright } [ Luke Wright ] suffered a side strain on { England } [ England ] duty and could miss the first two { Championship } [ County Championship ] matches. Add to that the possibility that { Chris Jordan } [ Chris Jordan (cricketer) ] could be on { England } [ England ] duty during the summer, and { Sussex } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] may be missing an opening batsman, { all-rounder } [ All-rounder ], and opening bowler, at various stages. On the positive side, { Matt Prior } [ Matt Prior ] will be determined to erase the memory of a disappointing { 2013 } [ 2013 Indian Premier League ], and his presence in the middle-order will be a major boost in the early season. The seam bowling department will be heavily dependent on the reliable { Steve Magoffin } [ Steve Magoffin ], while { Ashar Zaidi } [ Ashar Zaidi ] and { Will Beer } [ Will Beer ] will be competing for the vacant spinner's berth following the departure of { Monty Panesar } [ Monty Panesar ].One to watch: { Luke Wells } [ Luke Wells ] showed last season that he has the ability to bat for long periods, with his 208 at { The Oval } [ The Oval ] being a model of concentration and excellent shot selection. Playing grade cricket in { Australia } [ Australia ] over the winter will have improved his game further, and with { Chris Nash } [ Chris Nash (cricketer) ] initially absent, Wells has added responsibility at the top of the order.By BBC Sussex's Adrian HarmsCaptain: { Jim Troughton } [ Jim Troughton ]Overseas players: { Jeetan Patel } [ Jeetan Patel ] ( {New Zealand } [ New Zealand ]), { Shoaib Malik } [ Shoaib Malik ] ( {Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], for T20 Blast)How they did last season: { County Championship } [ County Championship ] D1: 4th, YB40: 7th in group, FL t20: 4th in group.Season prospects: { Warwickshire } [ Warwickshire County Cricket Club ] will take encouragement from having finished in the prize money in the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] last season despite a long list of injury problems and international call-ups. Fast bowler { Chris Wright } [ Chris Wright (cricketer) ] was especially missed in the second half of { 2013 } [ 2013 County Championship ] and avoiding similar problems this season will determine the county's prospects of success. A year after { Dougie Brown } [ Dougie Brown ] replaced { Ashley Giles } [ Ashley Giles ] as director of cricket, { Warwickshire } [ Warwickshire County Cricket Club ] have lost another key member of their backroom team, with bowling coach { Graeme Welch } [ Graeme Welch ] returning to { Derbyshire } [ Derbyshire County Cricket Club ], but { Alan Richardson } [ Alan Richardson (cricketer) ], lured back from { Worcestershire } [ Worcestershire County Cricket Club ], is a popular replacement. The county will expect to be competitive in the { Championship } [ County Championship ], but need to improve in both short formats of the game, though whether supporters from other parts of the county should care how the \" {Birmingham } [ Birmingham ] Bears\" get on in the T20 Blast is a moot point.One to watch: { Seam } [ Seam bowling ] bowler { Richard Jones } [ Richard Jones (cricketer, born 1965) ] has been snapped up from { Worcestershire } [ Worcestershire County Cricket Club ], and { Warwickshire } [ Warwickshire County Cricket Club ] will hope he can stay fit and build on some of the promise he showed at { New Road } [ New Road, Worcester ].

The pace attack looks a little thin and with four spinners on the books, including { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]'s { Saeed Ajmal } [ Saeed Ajmal ], it is unlikely there will be many 'green tops' at { New Road } [ New Road, Worcester ]. Inconsistent batting, { Moeen Ali } [ Moeen Ali ] apart, cost { Worcestershire } [ Worcestershire County Cricket Club ] last summer, although { Matt Pardoe } [ Matt Pardoe ] emerged as a solid opening partner to skipper { Daryl Mitchell } [ Daryl Mitchell ]. Ross Whiteley was another who looked good at times and with a full season, could become a useful { all-rounder } [ All-rounder ] {. } [ All-rounder ] One-day success of any sort has eluded { Worcestershire } [ Worcestershire County Cricket Club ] for some seasons and their { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ] form is among the worst in the country. Maybe the change of name to the { Rapids } [ Rapids (baseball) ] will speed things up.One to watch: { Tom Kohler-Cadmore } [ Tom Kohler-Cadmore ] broke { David Nash } [ David Nash (cricketer) ]'s record for most runs in a season for { Malvern College } [ Malvern College ] {. } [ Malvern College ] It will be a big step-up to full-time county cricket, but he looks a quality player.

The Tykes have a strong squad, well coached by { Jason Gillespie } [ Jason Gillespie (footballer) ], and have an exciting crop of young players to back up those with more experience. { Gillespie } [ Lee Gillespie ] has instilled an element of steel into the ranks and { Yorkshire } [ Yorkshire County Cricket Club ] have only lost two { Championship } [ County Championship ] games in the last two seasons. They were poor in both limited-overs competitions in 2013 and director of cricket, { Martyn Moxon } [ Martyn Moxon ] has called for a big improvement, especially in the T20, and with big-hitting { Australian } [ Australia ] { Aaron Finch } [ Aaron Finch ] set to arrive in May, they could repeat their trip to finals day in 2012. Without a trophy since { 2002 } [ 2002 in association football ], this should be a season when some silverware is finally obtained, most probably in the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ], having gone so close last year.One to watch: { Jonny Bairstow } [ Jonny Bairstow ] is a great talent who will feel he has something to prove after { England } [ England ] gave him limited opportunities in the winter down under.By { BBC Radio Leeds } [ BBC Radio Leeds ]' Dave CallaghanCompiled by { BBC Sport } [ BBC Sport ]'s { Paul Grunill } [ Paul Grunill ]."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170308233454/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12163624": "It is the hidden hand behind all { government } [ Government ] action.It is everywhere and nowhere at once.When { David Cameron } [ David Cameron ] unveiled his vision of a more socially active { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] - in which volunteers would step in to take the place of an over-mighty state - some { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] election candidates were incredulous.How were they supposed to sell this woolly nonsense on the doorstep? What did \"the big society\" even mean?But Mr Cameron was deadly serious - and eight months down the line, far from being quietly dropped as some assumed, or hoped, it might be, the big society is being pursued with surprising vigour across { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ].Everything from proposals to \"mutualise\" { post offices } [ Post office ] to a campaign to eradicate common ragwort from the { British } [ United Kingdom ] countryside have been talked up as examples of \"the big society in action\", as ministers and civil servants fall over themselves to show they are on board with the prime minister's favourite project.Some of this activity stems from a natural desire to please the new boss.\"There are things we are already doing we are trying to re-badge as big society - trying to show that they are in line with the big society,\" said one civil servant in a large { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ] department, who did not want to be named.And there is still confusion among { civil servants } [ Civil service ] about what the big { society } [ Society ] actually means - despite an on-going series of { seminars } [ Seminar ] across { Whitehall } [ Whitehall ] to explain it.\"What has been good is that they have stuck with the idea.

In the end {, } [ London ] it was just { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ] {. } [ London ]\" {Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] initially dismissed the big society idea as a con trick - a cynical attempt to slap a smiling face on savage spending cuts.But cannier shadow ministers began to wonder whether they should be praising the big society, not burying it.After all, who could argue with being nicer to your neighbours? Or devoting more time to the community?Now { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] leader { Ed Miliband } [ Ed Miliband ] says he is determined to claim the concept for his party.He is putting together a team of advisers to explore how to breathe new life into local communities by strengthening local institutions such as { post offices } [ Post office ] and { libraries } [ Library ], rather than handing them over to { volunteers } [ Volunteering ].The real test for \"the big society\", those on the { left } [ Left-wing politics ] argue, is the impact it will have in poorer parts of the country, particularly when funding is being cut to many { voluntary groups } [ Voluntary association ] and { community } [ Community ] projects.\"If the big { society } [ Society ] is going to be powerful, its power must be felt in deprived communities,\" says { Matthew Taylor } [ Matthew Taylor (art historian) ], who is chief executive of { The Royal Society of Arts } [ Royal Society of Arts ] {. } [ Royal Society of Arts ]Mr Cameron and the other architects of the concept represent relatively affluent { constituencies } [ Electoral district ], in { rural } [ Rural area ] areas, were there is a settled population and plenty of fit and active { retired } [ Retirement ] people with time on their hands for { volunteering } [ Volunteering ].It is a very different story, argues Mr Taylor, in the { inner cities } [ Inner city ], where the coalition's cuts are likely to hit the hardest - and where people often lack the confidence, or the spare time, to take over services such as { libraries } [ Library ] and { community centres } [ Community centre ] that might be facing closure.A former { local government } [ Local government ] regeneration chief, who did not want to be named, put it more bluntly: \"The { government } [ Government ] are completely unrealistic about what it means to someone living on an { inner city } [ Inner city ] { housing estate } [ Housing estate ]. They haven't got a bloody clue.\"Lord Wei, the government's Mr Big Society - who described it as a \"coral reef\" in his maiden { House of Lords } [ House of Lords ] speech - counters such criticism by pointing to the creation of the Big Society Bank, which will raid dormant bank accounts to provide up to \u00c2\u00a3100m for community projects, from April.There are also plans to despatch 5,000 community organisers into different parts of the country to try and get volunteers to work together more effectively.But critics say even { voluntary groups } [ Voluntary association ] and { local authorities } [ Local government ] who genuinely want to get involved with the \"big society\", lack the funds to do so - and are struggling to work out what the concept really means, as { ministers } [ Minister (government) ] have been steadfast in their refusal to spell it out.\"For those who hunger for simplicity and for administrative tidiness, for there to be a { White Paper } [ White paper ] which can kind of set out exactly what's going to happen, it's not going to be like that,\" said { Cabinet Office } [ Cabinet Office ] Minister { Francis Maude } [ Francis Maude ] when pressed for a definition on { BBC Radio 4 } [ BBC Radio 4 ]'s { PM } [ PM (BBC Radio 4) ] programme.\"The result of a big, strong { society } [ Society ] is that it will be administratively untidy. { People } [ People ] will come together to do things in different ways and different places.\"In the end, it may come down to the willingness of { civil servants } [ Civil service ] and other { professionals } [ Professional ] to trust the public, when handing over control of services, and in some cases funds, to groups of well-intentioned amateurs.Inevitably, some of these groups will turn out to be bungling amateurs, but ministers say they are relaxed about this too.Tory policy chief { Oliver Letwin } [ Oliver Letwin ], giving evidence to a { select committee } [ Select committee ] last week, summed up the government's self-consciously upbeat philosophy.\"Our intuition is that people are more likely to do great things - to innovate, to make things better - if they have a great deal of scope for { creativity } [ Creativity ] and a great deal of ability to make things happen on the ground.\"And as long as those who do it well succeed, and those who do it badly fail, you get an increasing drift towards success.\"He was talking about giving more freedom to { public servants } [ Civil service ], but it might equally work as a definition of \"the big society\", at least until something more concrete begins to emerge.Unless, in what might be an example of the { concept } [ Concept ] in action, you can think of a better one.Here is a selection of your comments:My wife has been replaced at our local hospital by a volunteer. Now we both have no { income } [ Income ] {. } [ Income ] If this is a by product of a \"big society\", then you can keep it.Chris, { Norwich } [ Norwich ]Isn't this just a case of putting a socially friendly brand name on a concept that's already in place? Take, for example, the { Territorial Army } [ Army Reserve (United Kingdom) ], { Special Constables } [ Special Constabulary ] & St. Johns Ambulance, { Lifeguards } [ Lifeguard ], volunteer outreach workers etc. - These established { volunteer } [ Volunteering ] groups have been around for a considerable time, and popularising them seems to be the key to the PM's budgeting. However, while the majority of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] may be generous, giving etc., there has to be a fair balance. individuals offering more to a governemnt that has already demanded so much, might be pushing it just a bit too much, no matter how they dress it up.Mike, { EssexOne } [ Essex ] would hope that a \"policy chief\" would have more sense than to say something as naive as \"And as long as those who do it well succeed, and those who do it badly fail, you get an increasing drift towards success. Who pays the liability insurance for the bungling amateurs? Who monitors their standards? What happens if the more successful amateurs refuse to move to parts of the country where there are no services because all the locals bungled it?Ian, { Biggleswade } [ Biggleswade ], { UK } [ United Kingdom ]The 'Big Society' already exists. And cleverer still, it allows deep cuts to be masked by a society where things still get done, but now for free. Whereas previously a society in { recession } [ Recession ] would stagnate, now Mr Cameron's { Eton } [ Eton College ] classmates will enjoy a future of tax cuts because hordes of pensioners and unemployed { public sector } [ Public sector ] workers will be fixing your roads and cleaning your streets for free. Genius. You can just imagine { Sir Humphrey } [ Humphrey, Earl of Snowdon ] explaining this to his { minister } [ Minister (government) ]. In truth the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] is a { Chimera } [ Chimera (mythology) ] because it is just another way of describing what already exists, people doing things for the { common good } [ Common good ], paid and unpaid. What seems to have been forgotten is that a lot of people have made decisions that they would rather pay someone else to do that work than spend their own time organising or participating. In more { affluent } [ Wealth ] societies that's what happens with { time } [ Time (magazine) ] poor individuals. So will the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] as conceived by Cameron lead to a patchwork of inefficient local initiatives that are totally inconsistent and doomed to failure in the long term as people loose interest and spend their time on other things?Steve, { London } [ London ] {Oliver Letwin } [ Oliver Letwin ] is quoted as saying, \"And as long as those who do it well succeed, and those who do it badly fail, you get an increasing drift towards success.\" That is all well and good as long as the { failure } [ Failure ] is recognised. I would hate to see the government perpetually funding failed attempts at { volunteers } [ Volunteering ] running services because they do not have the systems or checks in place to stop funding and replace the { volunteers } [ Volunteering ]. The big test will be the first couple of failures and how long it takes for someone to say, \"this isn't working.\"Jay, UKI think that the ' {Big Society } [ Big Society ]' is something that everyone intrinsically understands from the point of view of 'help your neighbour'. On our street we have an older couple who have lived here for several decades. When he went into { hospital } [ Hospital ], she was given daily rides to see him, dinners and lots of support - it wasn't co-ordinated, people just felt the need to help. 'London Citizens' is a good example - people band together to make positive changes such as 'City Safe' which asks local businesses to become 'Safe Havens' for youngsters threatened in the streets for example. I think that more people would get involved in the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] if they could quantify how it would positively affect their own { environment } [ Natural environment ] and as such, should always be looked at from a { local } [ Local community ] point of view.S Brethes, { London } [ London ]Catchy phrase for a vague concept. that has actually been around for donkey's years and has a pretty patchy record. A threatened { railway station } [ Train station ] was successfully taken over by a local { private school } [ Private school ], whilst a major plan to reopen a closed line has remained a plan for 30+years due to amateurs 'playing with trains', plus lack of direction and council support. But perhaps the most relevant insight is from { Matthew Taylor } [ Matthew Taylor (journalist) ], as echoed on { BBC Breakfast } [ BBC Breakfast ] today. Taking over a { library } [ Library ] is easier if you're in an affluent area with plenty of { middle aged } [ Middle age ], { middle class } [ Middle class ] do-gooders with too much time on their hands. It's only when this type of person is willing to give a bit more than patronising advice to the poorer section of { society } [ Society ] will we truly have a 'Big' { society } [ Society ].anglowelsh, { Wales } [ Wales ]The policy is total eyewash - it is just a cynical pretence that is meant to suggest that the { Tories } [ Tory ] actually care about disadvantaged people.Arthur, { South Shields } [ South Shields ]\" {The Big Society } [ The Big Society ]\" is only what vast numbers of people have been doing for decades in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ]. I am the eldest of 5 and my mother always used to say \"keep them busy and they stay out of mischief\" and we belonged to youth clubs, guides, scouts, st. john ambulance among many others and also did fund raising for large and small charities. It was never administered or organised, we just did what we fancied. And it meant { TV } [ Television ] was just a last resort when there was nothing else to do. I learnt all sorts of extra skills that have been a huge benefit and there is very little I regret in life now that I am in my 50s. There are loads of { volunteering } [ Volunteering ] { websites } [ Website ] and they will be delighted to hear from you. Trust me - you get just as much out of it as you put into it.LP, { South Wales } [ South Wales ]I think { Big Society } [ Big Society ] is a big con. Yes, of course I wish more people would do more for their communities - give time to { charities } [ Charitable organization ], be { volunteers } [ Volunteering ] for this and that. But it is NO SUBSTITUTE for properly run, properly resourced public services. And I have no doubt whatsoever that it is an attempt to get things that should be good quality { public services } [ Public service ] on the cheap. In many cases this will result in poorer, piecemeal services with untrained and unsupported staff. In the worst case this is potentially dangerous. Yes, if BS means a branch library that would have closed can remain open, then I'm all for it. If it means that challenging young people with complex needs on an { education } [ Education ] project get either no input or input by dangerously untrained and unsupervised { volunteers } [ Volunteering ] (which I think is the kind of thing that is going to happen) then I most definitely am not.Penny, { Devon } [ Devon ]I chair a local Community Group, all volunteers and { not for profit } [ Nonprofit organization ]. We provide { exercise } [ Exercise ] activities for { disabled } [ Disability ] { children } [ Child ] in our area.

Unfortunately the public purse only has cobwebs in it now - the public bodies who used to fund our work are being discontinued and can no longer fund us. Private business, who Mr Cameron assures us will mount the white charger and come to our rescue? Let's just say that they aren't falling over themselves to help. The few who do respond point out (quite fairly) that { charity } [ Charity (practice) ] begins at home and they're not making much { profit } [ Profit (economics) ] right now. I'm sure that we're just one of hundreds of similar stories nationwide. You already had a { Big Society } [ Big society ] Mr Cameron, you've just taken away their ability to provide services and replaced it with woolly words and empty promises.S Ward, { Nottingham } [ Nottingham ]Maybe senior { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] had their local communities in rural villages in { Buckinghamshire } [ Buckinghamshire ] or { Wiltshire } [ Wiltshire ] in mind when they came up with the big society. where mutualising the local { post office } [ Post office ] and protecting farmland diversity are big issues and where people might endeavour to take on these things if given the chance in an official way. but in { Lewisham } [ Lewisham ] {, } [ Lewisham ] round me {, } [ Lewisham ] I just don't see that happening. This whole notion is based around a small, close-knit and familiar community of small { rural } [ Rural area ] { towns } [ Town ] and { villages } [ Village ].Jack, { London } [ London ]Its about getting retired old busy bodies with nice comfortable pensions and time on their hands to take on the jobs of those younger less fortunate members of society who have no jobs, pensions and indeed no future, sacked as a consequence of the spending cuts imposed by this { Tory } [ Tory ] government. It conjures up twee visions of { England } [ England ] gone by, the village fete, tea parties, cricket on the green, { Dad's Army } [ Dad's Army ] and the Vicar of Dibley when the reality will be { Dickensian } [ Charles Dickens ] levels of poverty, ill-health and social division.Ian, Marske by the Sea, { Cleveland } [ Cleveland ]I wonder how long it took { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] think tanks or advertising people to come up with the name { The Big Society } [ The Big Society ] after studying { Green Party } [ Green Party of England and Wales ] or { Liberal Party } [ Liberal Party (UK) ] policy over the last 40 years. Whatever the answer, the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] should be embraced as a means to bring back the { human } [ Human ] scale to { communities } [ Community ].Tom, { Chester } [ Chester ]The purpose of the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] is to offload { Government } [ Government ] and { Local Authority } [ Local government ] spending, by delegating it to unpaid { volunteers } [ Volunteering ]. { As } [ As (song) ] a { Parish Councillor } [ Parish council ] {, } [ As (song) ] I'm seeing this \"on the ground {\". } [ As (song) ] However, some of this is simply not possible. Would you want a willing neighbour, with no knowledge of { Civil Engineering } [ Civil engineering ], to patch the frost-blown holes in your road? If the neighbour botches it, which is more than likely, who would the insurance claim from - the Parish Council, the neighbour, or the senior { Local Authorities } [ Local government ] whose delegation led to the situation? Sounds unreasonable? Our { County Council } [ County council ] is rumoured to want us to take over road repair in our Parish, but without giving us the cash to do it. That alone would probably empty the { Parish } [ Parish ] coffers, including the coming { Precept } [ Precept ] funds, in less than a year. Anyone know how to fix a street light?Jon, { Cambridge } [ Cambridge ]In my current position, I visit several Citizens Advice Bureaux. Each one is a { registered charity } [ Charitable organization ] which relies heavily on { volunteers } [ Volunteering ] and is part funded through { local authority } [ Local government ] funds and part through { Legal Services Commission } [ Legal Services Commission ]. Each and every one are currently going through redundancy procedures with their paid staff (support and administration mainly) because local authorities are struggling to find monies. By 2012, the LSC are looking to remove all legal aid except for the most severe cases (e.g. actual { homelessness } [ Homelessness ] - not threatened, loss of liberty, threat to life). There will be no money to employ caseworkers to deal with debt problems, benefit enquiries, employment issues etc. There is a serious risk that some Bureaux will close completely. Whilst the \" {Big Society } [ Big Society ] {\" } [ Big Society ] seems to be a clear and welcome effort, it cannot succeed if the basic { infrastructure } [ Infrastructure ] (i.e. Charities and NfP organisations) no longer exists.Simon, { Oldham } [ Oldham ]Why doesn't someone just say that the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] is what we're going to need if the vacuum left by a decimated { Big Government } [ Big government ] is left unfilled. It's going to be administratively untidy because the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] want nothing to do with it, nor do they want their affluent supporters to pay for the administration or regulation of it. The { Big Society } [ Big Society ] is being dressed up as developing { civil society } [ Civil society ] for rhetorical reasons - like we are supposed to blame ourselves if there are social problems caused by removing the { welfare state } [ Welfare state ]. We have a { civil society } [ Civil society ] - that's what makes us civilised - and I like contributing to its upkeep by giving some of the time spent doing my own job (in which I have skills) in the form of taxes to other people who are skilled at doing their jobs.Dominic, { Darlington } [ Darlington ]So, as far as I can see, the government expect the tax-payers to volunteer to do the things their taxes are paying for. Really - who in { this country } [ United Kingdom ] can afford to work for free? I certainly can't. And running something as important as a { library } [ Library ] is a full-time job for multiple people. And requires { skill } [ Skill ] and { experience } [ Experience ]. Voluntary work isn't free - it costs money to run it. So those twits in { government } [ Government ] think we should pay for the privilege running these services as well as working for free. It can't possibly work, it will never take off. And while I am paying { taxes } [ Tax ] for a { service } [ Service (economics) ] I expect the { government } [ Government ] to supply it - or give me my { money } [ Money ] back.Sandy, { Derby } [ Derby ]The sort of behaviour needed to create the big { society } [ Society ] is part of { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] {'s } [ United Kingdom ] { culture } [ Culture ], or not. Government can influence and encourage this sort of change in { culture } [ Culture ] but it will take many years. The idea that this can take up the slack from cuts in funding to public services in the next 12 months is fantasy.JWN1961, { Peterborough } [ Peterborough ]The \"Big Society\" is { communitarianistic } [ Communitarianism ] nonsense and should be treated as the individual squashing, { fabianistic } [ Fabianism ] bilge it really is. Want to see more { voluntary } [ Voluntaryism ] work Mr. Cameron? Stop robbing half my income or putting it on the shoulders of my children and grandchildren in the form of inter-generational debt.Thom, { Leeds } [ Leeds ]It is a blatant attempt to dismantle a system which guarantees a right to all citizens to have a minimum standard of living. This consists not only of the basics of food and shelter but { libraries } [ Library ] and { museums } [ Museum ] and { universities } [ University ] which don't cripple even the slightly better off for years ahead. I am one of the \"do-gooders\" who donate time to the local community and have done this willingly - and will continue to do so without financial reward - but I see this as over and above the provision of basic services. Charities are struggling to raise enough funds to keep going. I don't want to rely on the whims of local \"do-gooders\" to provide basic services. Britain is following the lead of { America } [ United States ] and I, for one, despair.Hazel, { Dartington } [ Dartington ]Ask not what the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] can do for you.Since I work full time, leave the house at 7 and get home at 6 (and I'm sure many people are out of the house longer hours) I have 1 1/2 hours in the evening with my children before their bed time. The weekends are { family } [ Family ] time. What does the { Big Society } [ Big Society ] want from me?RJ, { London } [ London ]At last we have a government mantra which actually resonates with the people! If it hadn't taken root the idea would have been dropped by now in line with similar schemes raised by other governments. Now we need to see if { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] will accept that this is a \"good idea\" from the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] and not just claim it for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] {'s } [ Labour Party (UK) ] own political ends which has been their tendency over the last few years. If { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] takes that step into line, the concept can really take hold across society and we can start to \"put the people back in government\". We don't need party political bickering, we need to just get on with it, especially when the financial situation is predicating total commitment from the country.Michael, { Warboys } [ Warboys ]I think the { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] party is being too pessimistic. Having worked with groups such as young carers I know that there are a large number of people who are very willing to give up there time for others. I know many readers genuinely care for their communities and posses a drive to help others, I can't foresee any problem in getting volunteers into inner city areas.Edward, { Ampleforth } [ Ampleforth ]Big Society in my area means the choice at { Parish Council } [ Parish councils in England ] level of losing your services in the rural areas, or paying more on the { Parish council } [ Parish councils in England ] tax to keep them. This equates to paying for services twice, once for local areas and again for the nearby towns where the same services are to be kept. We have seen this in our { libraries } [ Library ] already. Rural residents are now being asked to pay more to keep their local { library } [ Library ] {, } [ Library ] as well as continuing to pay for the council run ones that they cannot travel to.john, IOWThis sounds really bad - has nobody else noticed this is rather similar to the DoSac Fourth Sector Initiative from the TV series { The Thick of It } [ The Thick of It ]? Has Cameron been secretly writing scripts for the { BBC } [ BBC ]?Paul, { Reading } [ Reading, Berkshire ]Our high street is already run to a great deal by volunteers. The result: Constant decline. Volunteers don't earn money they can spend in shops. The { shops } [ Retail ] have less to { invest } [ Investment ] {. } [ Investment ] Business tax income for the council goes down. An economy in crisis needs proper jobs, properly paid, not its main commodity, { services } [ Service (economics) ] (in the absence of { manufacturing } [ Manufacturing ]), being taken over by { volunteers } [ Volunteering ].Arnim Friess, { Leamington Spa } [ Leamington Spa ]The big problem I have with the Big Society, as does the charity I am co-chair of, is that the phrase is being used day after day, but us at the coal face of running a charity have no idea, have been sent no information and cannot find any information on the Big Society! Are we supposed to be psychic to work out what it's all about? We've been planning how the charity can assist, but with no information, it's trying to find a small tiny needle in a huge haystack!Dan, { London } [ London ], UK'Big Society' - aren't these the things that local government, local { NHS } [ National Health Service ] etc used to do before they were encouraged to perform like 'Big Business'? And don't volunteers and the local community already do more than their fair share in, for example, providing hospice care? This is certainly the case here in { Cornwall } [ Cornwall ]. I'm afraid, Mr Cameron, that your vision of the ' {Big Society } [ Big Society ]' merely asks those of us fund-raising to introduce or maintain what should be basic health care (hospice care, care for sufferers of { multiple sclerosis } [ Multiple sclerosis ], ongoing { breast cancer } [ Breast cancer ] care, { oncological } [ Oncology ] services) to do more to replace what we always assumed our tax and { National Insurance } [ National Insurance ] were supposed to provide. You'll be asking us next, to pull together to support overpaid public servants and bankers!Dianne Seale, { Truro } [ Truro ], { UK } [ United Kingdom ]."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20160919103327/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32547167": "Her film { La Tete Haute } [ La Tete-Haute ], starring { Catherine Deneuve } [ Catherine Deneuve ], gives Bercot the dubious honour of being the first woman to open { Cannes } [ Cannes ] since { Diane Kurys } [ Diane Kurys ] in 1987.In fact, it's rather a defiantly { European } [ Europe ] slate of films in competition for the { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ], including directors { Paolo Sorrentino } [ Paolo Sorrentino ], { Nanni Moretti } [ Nanni Moretti ] and { Yorgos Lanthimos } [ Yorgos Lanthimos ] in the running.That's not to say { Cannes } [ Cannes ] will be without A-list powerhouse stars with { Tom Hardy } [ Tom Hardy ], { Charlize Theron } [ Charlize Theron ] and { Michael Fassbender } [ Michael Fassbender ] among those expected on the red carpet.Over the next week, we'll have more of the daily goings on at the world's biggest and oldest film festival.There are some interesting people to be met in { Cannes } [ Cannes ].Last night, I attended an event onboard a { yacht } [ Yacht ] which is looking to award { film } [ Film ] trailers - best { actor } [ Actor ]. in a { trailer } [ Trailer (promotion) ]. (Okay, the last one I may have just made up.)I spoke with a former { child actor } [ Child actor ] who is now a { director } [ Film director ]/ {producer } [ Film producer ] in { Thailand } [ Thailand ]. He was in { Cannes } [ Cannes ] in a semi-official capacity to promote the country's { film industry } [ Film industry ] and to sell { Thailand } [ Thailand ] as a location for { film } [ Film ] productions.I also met a very confident young { German } [ Germany ] in an evening suit, possibly the only one on board, who has a film showing in the { short film } [ Short film ] strand at { Cannes } [ Cannes ].Like I said, interesting people.No less interesting was the son of late actor { Steve McQueen } [ Steve McQueen (actor) ], in town to promote a { documentary } [ Documentary film ] about his father's struggle to create the racing film { Le Mans } [ Le Mans (film) ] in 1970.Now a custodian of the { McQueen } [ McQueen Estate ] estate, he himself is a former { racing driver } [ Auto racing ] who still bears the some physical scars from an horrific crash which almost cost him his life.He is also a former { actor } [ Actor ] (and this is where I get really geeky) who played one of { Danny Laruso } [ Danny Laruso ]'s tormenters in the original { Karate Kid } [ The Karate Kid ] { film } [ Film ].\"My son is an actor, he's in a TV show called { Vampire Diaries } [ The Vampire Diaries ] so I tell him not to worry, that talent in our family clearly skips a generation, so he should be fine,\" he joked.Sadly the biggest low was { Gus Van Sant } [ Gus Van Sant ]'s misfiring Sea of Trees, one which I had been looking forward to. Never mind { Gus } [ Gus (Halloween) ] {, } [ Halloween ] there's always next year.Showing as part of the director's fortnight at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] is the film { Green Room } [ Green Room (film) ] and, with more than a week of the festival yet to run, it is already a contender for the most brutally violent film to be given an official screening.On top of that, { British } [ United Kingdom ] national treasure { Patrick Stewart } [ Patrick Stewart ] plays the leader of a { white power } [ White nationalism ] gang.The basic premise is that a travelling { punk } [ Punk rock ] band are offered a gig at a { skinhead } [ Skinhead ] bar deep in the backwoods of { Portland } [ Portland, Oregon ]. There they witness the aftermath of a { murder } [ Murder ] and are barricaded inside the { bar } [ Bar ]'s dressing room - the Green Room of the title.What follows is an hour and half siege/horror movie, during which the { Nazi } [ Nazi Germany ] gang try to break into the room as the band frantically try to find a way out.There are slashings, shootings, dog attacks and a particularly gruesome disembowelling. And it's all to a thrashing { hardcore } [ Hardcore punk ] { punk } [ Punk rock ] { soundtrack } [ Soundtrack ] {. } [ Soundtrack ] It's really quite a lot of fun. If you like that sort of thing.Stewart's accent veers between { RSC } [ Royal Shakespeare Company ] and generic { American } [ United States ], but { Star Trek } [ Star Trek ] actor { Anton Yelchin } [ Anton Yelchin ] is good in his role as the softly spoken yet surprisingly resilient guitar player.There is also a neat { running gag } [ Running gag ] about picking one { band } [ Band (rock and pop) ] you could listen to if you were deserted on an { island } [ Island ], with a great pay-off in the { film } [ Film ]'s closing moments.Not one for the faint-hearted or weak of stomach, but a treat for gore aficionados.American director { Todd Haynes } [ Todd Haynes ] has announced his return to { Cannes } [ Cannes ] with a finely crafted feature which is already generating buzz as a genuine contender for this year's { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ].Carol, a love story between two women set during the socially uptight 1950s, stars { Cate Blanchett } [ Cate Blanchett ] and { Rooney Mara } [ Rooney Mara ] - best known for the { US } [ United States ] remake of { The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo } [ The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film) ].It is based on a 1952 novel by { Patricia Highsmith } [ Patricia Highsmith ], { The Price of Salt } [ The Price of Salt ], then considered hugely controversial for its portrayal of a { lesbian } [ Lesbian ] relationship but now recognised as a ground-breaking work.Mara is impressive as the younger women transfixed by the older { socialite } [ Socialite ], who leaves a pair of gloves behind during their first meeting at a { department store } [ Department store ]. At one point during their exchange, { Blanchett } [ Patricia Blanchett ] remarks on { Mara } [ Mara Brock Akkadian ]'s oddness saying she seems to have fallen from space.Mara's stillness gives a sense of the character's struggle to understand the new feelings she has for this woman. She quizzes her boyfriend on what he thinks about two women or two men who fall in love. It is a test of herself as much as a test of him.But the { film } [ Film ] belongs to { Blanchett } [anchett ] {, } [ Blanchett ] whose latent ability to disappear into every character she plays continues to wow audiences and delight { critics } [ Film criticism ].Every look, every elegant gesture is loaded with meaning and yet the performance is understated, in comparison with { Woody Allen } [ Woody Allen ]'s { Blue Jasmine } [ Blue Jasmine ] which earned her an { Oscar } [ Academy Awards ] two years ago,And, as early in the year as we still are, some are already suggesting that, come awards season, this performance and this film, will be recognised with some nominations.Another film in competition, is the { French } [ France ] relationship drama Mon Roi (My King).Starring { Emmanuelle Bercot } [ Emmanuelle Bercot ] - whose film { Standing Tall } [ Standing Tall (film) ] opened this year's festival - and { Vincent Cassel } [ Vincent Cassel ], who has already been seen in the { Matteo Garrone } [ Matteo Garrone ] fairytale Tale of Tales, it's a story of addiction.Bercot's { lawyer } [ Lawyer ] is addicted to Cassel and his joie de vivre and over ten years we watch their relationship develop. They fall in love, they fight, they separate, they reunite. Neither can live without the other, nor can they live with each other.Funny and sad, plus two great performances from { Cassel } [ Paul Cassel ] and { Bercot } [ Anthony Bercot ].Asif Kapadia's Amy, about the life of singer { Amy Winehouse } [ Amy Winehouse ] serves as a sad reminder of the huge talent that was lost when she died in 2011 at the age of just 27.Using archive footage of { Winehouse } [ Amy Winehouse ] from childhood and throughout her glittering but all too brief career, the { BAFTA-winning } [ British Academy of Film and Television Arts ] filmmakers paint a portrait of a smart, funny, emotional, supremely talented but troubled young woman.The story is told by those who knew her best, her oldest friends who stuck by her from childhood throughout her later fame, { alcoholism } [ Alcoholism ] and { drug abuse } [ Substance abuse ] {. } [ Substance abuse ]It includes testimony from her former husband, managers and musician friends such as { Salaam Remi } [ Salaam Remi ] - who produced her { Back to Black } [ Back to Black ] album - { Mark Ronson } [ Mark Ronson ], rapper { Mos Def } [ Mos Def ] and her idol, { Tony Bennett } [ Tony Bennett ].Her father { Mitch Winehouse } [ Mitch Winehouse ] is also featured, as is { her mother } [ Mary Winehouse ], but the family have since distanced themselves from the film and it's not difficult to see why.They do come in for some criticism, { Mitch } [ Mitch Miller ] in particular. An example being when he brings his own { TV } [ Television ] crew to { St Lucia } [ Saint Lucia ], where his daughter was trying to stay clean from { drink } [ Alcoholic drink ] and { drugs } [ Drug ].An awkward exchange with some { fans } [ Fan (person) ] starts a small row, as she tells him that his cameras make her feel \"like a mug\".Inevitably the finger of blame is also pointed at the { media } [ Mass media ], in particular, the { British } [ United Kingdom ] { tabloid } [ Tabloid (newspaper format) ] press and its voracious appetite to document the fall from grace of a young singing superstar.What comes across from the combined testimony, and clips of { Amy } [ Amy (band) ] herself, is that she never craved fame, never wanted celebrity and was never happier than when in the studio armed with a { guitar } [ Guitar ] and a { microphone } [ Microphone ]. Or in front of an audience of 50 at some smoky { jazz } [ Jazz ] club.Footage shot just months before her death, singing opposite { Bennett } [ Bennett (singer) ] for a duets { album } [ Album ], are touching, the shy 20-something eager to impress a man, a music legend, whose songs she has held dear since childhood.\"I'm like you, every take is different,\" the older { singer } [ Singing ] says soothingly to the bashful and starstruck young { artist } [ Artist ].\"No, I'm like you is what you mean,\" she counters. \"I'm like you.\"Somewhat fitting the final words are left to the 88-year-old { jazzman } [ Jazz ] as he eulogises: \"Life teaches you how to live. As long as you live long enough to learn.\"Wonderful words spoken tragically too late for { Amy Winehouse } [ Amy Winehouse ] to hear.Amy, directed by { Asif Kapadia } [ Asif Kapadia ], whose documentary about the late { F1 } [ Formula One ] driver { Ayrton Senna } [ Ayrton Senna ] was a huge critical hit around the world, has already generated some controversy. { Winehouse } [ Amy Winehouse ] {'s } [ Amy Winehouse ] family {, } [ Amy Winehouse ] which initially backed the film has withdrawn { its } [ Amy Winehouse ] support {. } [ Amy Winehouse ]Her { father } [ Michael Jackson ] in particular, has complained that it paints an unfair and inaccurate portrait of their relationship.Later tonight is the first screening of { Todd Hayne } [ Todd Hayne ]'s film { Carol } [ Carol (film) ] which stars { Cate Blanchett } [ Cate Blanchett ] and { Rooney Mara } [ Rooney Mara ] as women in love in the 1950s set drama.So the first real boos at this year's { Cannes } [ Cannes ] and it was for a former favourite on the Croisette Gus Van Sant. His new film { Sea of Trees } [ Sea of Trees ] sees { Matthew McConaughey } [ Matthew McConaughey ] as a suicidal scientist who travels to a beautiful forest at the foot of { Mount Fuji } [ Mount Fuji ] in { Japan } [ Japan ] to do the deed.There he meets a similarly lost and blooded soul, in the form of { Ken Watanabe } [ Ken Watanabe ], who forces him to re-evaluate his decision to kill himself.Such a sensitive subject matter is not handled particularly well and the { film } [ Film ] quickly becomes a buddy movie survival-style romp. Flashbacks to { McConaughey } [ Matthew McConaughey ]'s troubled marriage to { Naomi Watts } [ Naomi Watts ] and a fireside confession scene end in a denouement which was easy to see coming and dripped of sentimentality.As the credit rolled, there were sounds of boos and jeers from the balcony. Which would not have been music to the ears of the { director } [ Film director ] who is due in town with his stars to promote the { movie } [ Film ].It's in the running for the { Palme d'Or } [ Palme d'Or ] but on the reaction of this crowd, a win is not particularly likely.Single people are sent to a { hotel } [ Hotel ] to find { love } [ Love ] {. } [ Love ] If they find a { mate } [ Sexual partner ] who shares similar attributes, they can return to the { city } [ City ] to live in { happiness } [ Happiness ]. If they fail {, } [ Sverdlovsk Oblast ] they become { animals } [ Animal ] and are allowed to roam the { forest } [ Forest ] {. } [ Sverdlovsk Oblast ] Or they can choose to be loners and live a { feral } [ Feral ] existence in the woods, where they risk capture and involuntary { metamorphosis } [ Metamorphosis ] into a creature.Yup, { The Lobster } [ The Lobster ], by { Greek } [ Greece ] director { Yorgos Lanthimos } [ Yorgos Lanthimos ] is definitely as weird as it sounds.We follow David, the only named character (played by { Colin Farrell } [ Colin Farrell ]) as he tries to find love in the most oppressive of places, the tightly regimented hotel - run by { Olivia Colman } [ Olivia Colman ].He is joined on his quest for love by { John C Reilly } [ John C. Reilly ] as Lisping Man and { Ben Whishaw } [ Ben Whishaw ] as Limping Man. Extras star { Ashley Jensen } [ Ashley Jensen ] plays Biscuit Woman. Seriously.What follows is a bizarre, frightening, moving and darkly funny tale. And one which is very much open to interpretation.Rachel Weisz, who - as short-sighted woman - may be David's saviour said: \"One of my friends thinks its a scathing satire on suburbia. To me, the first thing I think of is { narcissism } [ Narcissism ], that you have to fall in { love } [ Love ] with someone who has similar qualities to yourself.\"\"I don't think I really know what the { film } [ Film ] is about,\" said { Whishaw } [ Adam Whishaw ] - who is yet to se the completed { film } [ Film ]. \"I suspect it's a { film } [ Film ] that would make you feel differently every time you see it.\" {Farrell } [ Sean Farrell ], who sports a moustache and middle-aged paunch throughout the movie, added: \"One thing that stayed with me after I read the script was the deep loneliness that permeates it.\"But just being in it doesn't mean I know more about this than any audience member who will see it.\"As an { audience } [ Audience ] member I can attest to that. I enjoyed it but I'm still trying to decide what it was all about.Maybe I never will.Possibly the strangest { film } [ Film ] in { competition } [ Competition ] this year is about to begin. The Lobster is set in a near future when people have 45 days to find love in a hotel or they must be turned in to an animal and released into the woods. Expecting some weird goings-on.Elsewhere, the new { documentary } [ Documentary film ] Steve McQueen: The Man and Le Mans, about his torturous labour of love, a movie about motor racing shot at top speeds, has screened.It's an interesting insight into the { actor } [ Actor ] and the behind the scenes struggles to get the { movie } [ Film ] made. For some, the film was a pure recreation of what makes a man drive a car at over 200mph, for others it's massively self-indulgent and almost unwatchable.I'll be speaking to the { filmmakers } [ Film director ] and { McQueen } [ McQueen (film) ]'s son { Chad } [ Chad McQueen ] on Monday.Managed to see last night's opening film at { Cannes } [ Cannes ], the { French } [ France ] drama La Tete Haute (or Standing Tall in { English } [ English language ]).Directed by { Emmanuelle Bercot } [ Emmanuelle Bercot ] and starring { Catherine Deneuve } [ Catherine Deneuve ] and first-time actor { Rod Paradot } [ Rod Paradot ], it tells the story of a young delinquent and the exhaustive attempts by the local authorities to help him curb his anti-social behaviour which revolves mainly around bunking off school and stealing cars.Deneuve is a steely, yet kind-hearted { juvenile court } [ Juvenile court ] { judge } [ Judge ], perhaps the one { authority figure } [ Authority ] who can get through to the volatile and violent { teenager } [ Adolescence ].In { Paradot } [ Paradot (film) ], there is a refreshing un-actorly performance, often raw and explosive and he exudes cockiness and vulnerability in equal measure. However, the untethered performance of an { amateur } [ Amateur ] performer brings its own problem as there is little to show in the way of { character development } [ Character arc ], permanently rooted as he is in the role of angry { teenager } [ Adolescence ].The { drama } [ Drama ] often relies on the { procedural } [ Procedural drama ], with frequent expository explanations of how the { French } [ France ] juvenile system works. His mildly { drug addicted } [ Addiction ] mother is also something of a { stereotype } [ Stereotype ].That fact this was selected as the opening film for this year's { Cannes } [ Cannes ] however, over a { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ] crowd-pleaser, is not to be overlooked.Perhaps still stinging from the vicious reviews for last year's { Grace of Monaco } [ Grace of Monaco ] and the lukewarn reaction to { The Great Gatsby } [ The Great Gatsby (2013 film) ] a year earlier, the festival organisers are putting a { French } [ France ] stamp on { Cannes } [ Cannes ].And Standing Tall, though not a perfect { film } [ Film ], was certainly an admirable choice on their part.Think { Point Break } [ Point Break ], an undercover thriller but without { Patrick Swayze } [ Patrick Swayze ], amazing action sequences and surfing, set it in { France } [ France ] over a century ago and you're in the right ballpark for the film { The Anarchists } [ The Anarchists (film) ].It stars two actors who both made a splash at previous { Cannes } [ Cannes ] festivals.Tahar Rahim, whose blistering performance in { A Prophet } [ A Prophet ] made him one of { Europe } [ Europe ]'s hottest talents, stars as Jean, a lowly policeman in 1899 { Paris } [ Paris ], sent by his senior officer to infiltrate a gang of anarchists - bent on ending the subjugation of the poor working classes by destroying the bourgeois,There,  he is inevitably drawn in to the close inner circle of the band's passionate leader and his beautiful girlfriend, played by { Adele Exarchopoulos } [ Adele Exarchopoulos ], who shared the Palme d'Or award at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] with { Lea Seydoux } [ Lea Seydoux ] and director { Abdellatif Kechiche } [ Abdellatif Kechiche ] for the explicit lesbian love story Blue is the Warmest Colour.Jean's loyalties are tested and he is torn between his duty to serve, his growing friendship with Elisee and his feelings for Judith.The grimy underbelly of { working class } [ Working class ] { Paris } [ Paris ] is well recreated and the performances are strong. It moves a little slowly in places but the stakes are high as the conclusion moves towards the planning of a violent attack.What is perhaps a little disappointing is that, for a group calling themselves { anarchists } [ Anarchism ], actual { anarchy } [ Anarchy ] is in short supply. These would-be { rebels } [ Rebellion ] prefer instead to sit about { drinking } [ Drinking ] and musing on whether { social change } [ Social change ] should ever justify { violence } [ Violence ].There is a bank heist, which naturally ends with a casualty, like I said { Point Break } [ Point Break ] but definitely not as slick as the Ex Presidents. But at least they too never go for the vault.The { film } [ Film ] is screening as part of the critics fortnight strand. There's a lot there to like but I was frustrated at a lack of genuine suspense. Like { Jean } [ Jean Giraud ], I was torn.Every once in a while a { film } [ Film ] comes along which is just a little bit different than everything else you will see at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] {. } [ Cannes ]Such is the case with the new { film } [ Film ] by { Italian } [ Italy ] { director } [ Film director ] { Matteo Garrone } [ Matteo Garrone ]. This is his first film in the { English } [ English language ] language and his first in the realm of { fantasy } [ Fantasy ] {. } [ Fantasy ]Tale of Tales is a twisted fairytale { portmanteau } [ Portmanteau ] of three separate stories, which nevertheless are also finely connected.Based on the stories of the 17th Century writer { Giambattista Basile } [ Giambattista Basile ], this is a world of sea monsters and ogres, witches and magic.One story tells the tale of a lustful king who mistakes the voice of old crone for that of a young girl and goes all out to woo her. Another tells of a distracted { monarch } [ Monarch ] who is more obsessed by his pet { flea } [ Flea ] than the daughter he is about to marry off to a mindless { giant } [ Giant ].Salma { Hayek } [ Salma Hayek ] plays an obsessed queen whose desire for a child robs her of everything else she holds dear.It's an all-star cast, with appearances from the likes of { Toby Jones } [ Toby Jones ], { Vincent Cassel } [ Vincent Cassel ], and { John C Reilly } [ John C. Reilly ]. Much has been made of { Garrone } [ Garrone ]'s foray into { English } [ English language ], perhaps to broaden his appeal beyond { Europe } [ Europe ]'s borders. But the { film } [ Film ] has such a defiantly { European } [ Europe ] sensibility that it's a risky move by the { director } [ Film director ], who may alienate his existing { audience } [ Audience ].However, it's lavish, beautifully realised and darkly funny.An interesting proposition this morning is a { film } [ Film ] screening as part of the { critics } [ Film criticism ]' { fortnight } [ Fortnight ] {. } [ Fortnight ] The Anarchists stars Tahar Rahim, who made his name in the film { A Prophet } [ A Prophet ], and { Adele Exarchopoulos } [ Adele Exarchopoulos ], who shared the best actress title with { Lea Seydoux } [ Lea Seydoux ] for Blue is the Warmest Colour at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] two years ago.Set in { Paris } [ Paris ] in 1899, the period drama tells the story of a humble { police } [ Police ] corporal sent to infiltrate a group of { anarchists } [ Anarchism ], who finds his loyalties tested when he falls in love with one of them.So we begin this morning, whisked off in people carriers with tinted windows to the impossibly glamorous and exclusive Hotel du Cap, about 30 minutes outside of { Cannes } [ Cannes ], to meet the director and cast of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max: Fury Road.Sadly there was no grand entrance through the { hotel } [ Hotel ] lobby - instead we were taken around the back of the building, through the tradesmen's entrance as it were.Luckily any fears of feeling a little bit like a dirty secret were allayed by the youthful enthusiasm of the film's 70-year-old director { George Miller } [ George Miller (director) ].\" {Mel } [ Mel Gibson ] sat beside me at the premiere with { Tom Hardy } [ Tom Hardy ] sat behind us and { Mel } [ Mel Gibson ] is one of those people who can't censor himself. I kept seeing him chuckle.\"He's directing a movie in { Australia } [ Australia ] now and would ask, 'Oh who's that { actor } [ Actor ]?' He really loved it and it meant a lot to me and he gave me a hug.\"He's a great film-maker and I know he's had awful problems but he's a really good man struggling with his demons. I got his respect as a film-maker which was great.\"Hardy stars as the largely silent { Max } [ Max Goebbels ], while { Nicholas Hoult } [ Nicholas Hoult ] plays \"war boy\" { Nux } [ Nux (character) ], a devoted follower of the movie's bad guy Immortan Joe.The { original film } [ The Godfather ] was already more than a decade old by the time { Hoult } [oult (film) ] was born, and he admits he'd never seen it before he auditioned for the part.\"I had seen { George } [ George Harrison ]'s other films, like { Happy Feet } [ Happy Feet ], but I was amazed that no -one had told me about them.\"But then all these pop culture references made more sense to me, watching { Tupac } [ Tupac Shakur ] and { Dr Dre } [ Dr. Dre ]'s { California } [ California ] video and seeing this is where all of those guys got their ideas from.\"Hardy's first exposure to the violent films was a little more damaging, he says.\"I was about six or seven and I saw my cousins watching it and it was just weird because I was young and it's quite grown-up.\"It's very unusual and { I } [ I (band) ] didn't understand it, a bit like the first time { I } [ I (band) ] heard { Jimi Hendrix } [ Jimi Hendrix ] as a kid, it was too grown up for { me } [ I (band) ].\"I felt a little bit dirty and a little bit abused and I kind of left it because it's odd. Then later when I was about 15, I knew about it. I knew about the character and the Interceptor (Max's power { V8 } [ V8 engine ] engine car) but I still had never seen it.\"I got a { dog } [ Dog ] called { Mad Max } [ Mad Max ] when I was 17 and I didn't like the name because I remember the { film } [ Film ] and it was weird. So I changed his name and he died the year I was offered { Max } [ Max (1955 film) ], and then I watched the movie and then I got it.\"That would make his { dog } [ Dog ] about 20 when he died, which is pretty old.Charlize Theron, Imperator Furiosa in the movie, arrived with a glass of tomato juice, which could have been mistakenly identified by yours truly as a { Bloody Mary } [ Bloody Mary (cocktail) ].\"No, this is { virgin } [ Virginity ] all the way,\" she insists. \"There are too many { studio } [ Television studio ] people about, I don't want to get fired.\"The { film } [ Film ], surprisingly, has a strong { feminist } [ Feminism ] streak. Her character is, to put it simply, a bit of a bad ass - not to be messed with, she drives a massive rig called the War Machine and is central to the film's plot.More importantly, she is not there to serve out a romantic storyline between her character and { Max } [ Max Branning ].\"You can't say 'the stakes are this high' and you're literally in a driving war and we cannot stop because 'if we stop, we die' - and then have them pull off to the side of the road to have sex, like fall in love, because then immediately the anxiety has been relieved for the audience.\"Unfortunately some { film-makers } [ Film director ] think you can have both. What was great about this is that the luxury of a love story was not where we were, I mean they can't even talk to each other.\"We never even talked about it - it was never there, no one said 'maybe', we never had to fight against it.\"It was always going to be two warriors on par, starting off with very little respect for each other and ending up with a massive respect for each other.\" {Mad Max } [ Mad Max ]: { Fury Road } [ Mad Max Fury Road ] is showing out of competition. Find out what else is screening at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] this year with our guide to the films to watch out for.You know it's going to be a { Cannes Film Festival } [ Cannes Film Festival ] of excitement and unpredictability when, on arriving at the airport in { Nice } [ Nice ], you spot - in no particular order { Charlize Theron } [ Charlize Theron ], { John Legend } [ John Legend ] and.I should add they didn't all arrive together. Which would have been weird.The festival itself kicks off later, not with a { Hollywood } [ Hollywood ] movie, but rather a { French } [ France ] drama { Standing Tall } [ Standing Tall (film) ], directed by Emanuelle Bercot.Or maybe it was just a great opportunity to open the oldest and most { French } [ France ] of { film festivals } [ Film festival ] with a local tale, starring the first lady of { French } [ France ] cinema { Catherine Deneuve } [ Catherine Deneuve ].Either way, there is a lot of excitement ahead of the first opening film at { Cannes } [ Cannes ] to be directed by a woman since { 1987 } [ 1987 Cannes Film Festival ] {. } [ 1987 Cannes Film Festival ] He's taken on the { iconic } [ Cultural icon ] role first played by { Mel Gibson } [ Mel Gibson ] more than 30 years ago.Aimed squarely at petrolheads and { Fast and Furious } [ Fast and Furious ] fiends, the film nevertheless has a strong { feminist } [ Feminism ] streak slicing through the male { machismo } [ Machismo ].There is some truly astounding stunt work on the chase scenes, filmed in a north { African } [ Africa ] desert, and the cinematography is incredible. And it has souped up { cars } [ Car ] and { trucks } [ Truck ] - lots of them. All very powerful and very, very loud.Bercot's drama, about a { French } [ France ] delinquent, seems almost sedate by comparison.Which one is Mr { Aspel } [ David Aspel ] looking forward to most?."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170120021511/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14542438": "550-330 BC - { Achaemenid } [ Achaemenid Empire ] dynasty rules the first { Persian Empire } [ Persian Empire ] {. } [ Persian Empire ] At its greatest extent under { Darius I } [ Darius the Great ] stretches from the { Aegean Sea } [ Aegean Sea ] and { Libya } [ Libya ] to the { Indus Valley } [ Indus River ].The ruined city of { Persepolis } [ Persepolis ] testifies to the grandeur of the first { Persian Empire } [ Persian Empire ]492-479 - { Persian } [ Iran ] attempts to conquer { Greece } [ Greece ] fail.330 - { Alexander the Great } [ Alexander the Great ] of { Macedon } [ Macedonia (ancient kingdom) ] conquers the { Persian Empire } [ Persian Empire ], founding a short-lived empire before dying in { Babylon } [ Babylon ] in 323.312-140 - Most of { Persia } [ Iran ] is part of the Greek-dominated (Hellenistic) { Seleucid Empire } [ Seleucid Empire ], founded by a general of { Alexander the Great } [ Alexander the Great ].140 BC - 224 AD - { Persia } [ Iran ] - known as the { Parthian Empire } [ Parthian Empire ] - under the rule of the { Arsacid } [ Arsacid dynasty of Persia ] dynasty.224-651 AD - { Sassanid } [ Sasanian Empire ] dynasty rules { Persian Empire } [ Persian Empire ];

He has been the subject of three offers, all of which have been instantly rejected by { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ]'s owners { Fenway Sports Group } [ Fenway Sports Group ] {. } [ Fenway Sports Group ]The last bid would have added up to \u00a3118m - the largest fee ever received by a { British } [ United Kingdom ] club - but it came with a series of strings attached, including one payment reliant on { Coutinho } [ Philippe Coutinho ] winning the { Ballon d'Or } [ Ballon d'Or ] {. } [ Ballon d'Or ]The word inside { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] is the size of any bid is irrelevant because { Coutinho } [ Philippe Coutinho ] is not for sale at any price, a policy reinforced by a public { FSG } [ FSG ] statement even before his emailed transfer demand.So what could happen in the final days before the window closes?There have been rumours of a fourth { Barca } [ FC Barcelona ] bid but it is yet to arrive - and it remains to be seen if { Coutinho } [ Philippe Coutinho ] or his camp make further moves or representations in an attempt to force a transfer.The problem for { Coutinho } [ Philippe Coutinho ] is { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] are not moving. They have not moved from day one.There is, of course, the danger the club could be left with a disaffected player on Friday morning, but their admirably strong stance suggests confidence in their ability to reintegrate { Coutinho } [ Philippe Coutinho ].Liverpool have the same problem themselves as they meet a wall of resistance from { Southampton } [ Southampton F.C. ] in their attempts to land their prime summer target, { Virgil van Dijk } [ Virgil van Dijk ].Anfield was understood to be the 26-year-old's preferred destination once his mind was made up to leave { St Mary's } [ St Mary's Stadium ], but { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] publicly apologised to { Saints } [ St Mary's F.C. ] and withdrew interest amid claims of an illegal approach.The Reds remain interested and would readily pay \u00a360m for the { Netherlands } [ Netherlands ] defender given the slightest encouragement, but { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] and { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] would be equally responsive.Southampton, however, have made it clear { Van Dijk } [ijk van Dijk ] will not be sold, a position reiterated by vice-chairman (football) { Les Reed } [ Les Reed (footballer) ] when he said \u00a315m signing { Wesley Hoedt } [ Wesley Hoedt ] had been bought to play alongside his international colleague, not replace him.The disenchanted { Van Dijk } [ijk ] has virtually been in exile all summer, so will the pressure of the clock ticking down and the likelihood of interested clubs making one last persuasive attempt provoke a change of heart? {Southampton } [ Southampton F.C. ] would have to alter their position drastically.And what about { Alexis Sanchez } [ Alexis Sanchez ]? The { Chilean } [ Chile ] is showing no sign of agreeing a new { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] contract, yet manager { Arsene Wenger } [ Arsene Wenger ] seems ready to risk losing an asset worth at least \u00a350m in the current market in exchange for one final season from him.Manchester City are following events closely, and may even try a blockbuster offer before the window closes.Given { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] {'s } [ Arsenal F.C. ] poor start to the season, and their need to strengthen in other areas, will { Wenger } [ Ars\u00e8ne Wenger ] move his position and decide to cash in rather than see { Sanchez } [ Sanchez (footballer) ] walk out of { Emirates Stadium } [ Emirates Stadium ] for free next summer.One thing is certain - { Diego Costa } [ Diego Costa ] will not play for { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] again. The { striker } [ Forward (association football) ]'s relationship with { manager } [ Manager (association football) ] { Antonio Conte } [ Antonio Conte ] is not so much fractured as smashed into hundreds of tiny pieces, the process starting last January.Claim and counter claim have been traded as the { striker } [ Forward (association football) ] remains away from the club, and a move is the only realistic option for both parties. There will be no mending of fences.The complication is { Costa } [ Juan Antonio Costa ]'s desired destination, his former club { Atletico Madrid } [ Atl\u00e9tico Madrid ] {, } [ Atl\u00e9tico Madrid ] are banned from signing players until January.This leaves { Costa } [ Liga AC ], and indeed { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] {, } [ Chelsea F.C. ] in limbo.It will surely make for a toxic atmosphere if { Costa } [ Juan Antonio Costa ] hangs around until January, but what are the serious alternatives?A loan move until January, perhaps? { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ] manager { Ronald Koeman } [ Ronald Koeman ] has declared his admiration for { Costa } [ Juan Antonio Costa ] but the { Dutchman } [ Netherlands ] is someone who answers every question in a blunt, honest manner and of course he would take the { Spain } [ Spain ] international if he could.Everton midfielder { Ross Barkley } [ Ross Barkley ] is at a career crossroads at only 23 - but what route he takes is still unclear.Barkley has turned down a lucrative new contract at his boyhood club, and his fractious relationship with { Koeman } [eman (footballer) ] has made a parting of the ways look inevitable.Now things get difficult.Barkley has attracted interest from { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] and { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] but { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ] have received no offer. And while their demand for \u00a350m for an { England } [ England ] { midfielder } [ Midfielder ] in the final year of his contract can be filed under 'fanciful', they will not be parting for much under \u00a330m.To add to the intrigue, { Barkley } [ Ross Barkley ] is expected to be out until October with a { hamstring } [ Hamstring ] injury, so whoever (if anyone) buys him will first have to nurse him back to fitness.It is highly likely { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ] will receive an offer before Thursday, but this one might go down to the wire.Koeman has made all the right noises about what might happen if { Barkley } [ Ross Barkley ] stays, but where would he play after Koeman spent \u00a324m on { Ajax } [ AFC Ajax ] captain { Davy Klaassen } [ Davy Klaassen ] and a club record \u00a345m on { Swansea City } [ Swansea City A.F.C. ]'s { Gylfi Sigurdsson } [ Gylfi Sigurdsson ]?This could be a late one.Three games into the new season this is hardly a crisis for { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ], but two losses and the alarming manner of their harrowing 4-0 loss at { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] on Sunday has left manager { Arsene Wenger } [ Arsene Wenger ] facing familiar questions.Wenger's future is sorted after he signed a new two-year contract but it will not be a shield against inevitable criticism when { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] show no signs of curing the failings that have been levelled at them for several years under the { Frenchman } [ France ].At { Anfield } [ Anfield ] {, } [ Liverpool F.C. ] { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] lacked fight {, } [ Liverpool F.C. ] physical presence in all parts of the pitch {, } [ Liverpool F.C. ] and a competitive edge.

Van Dijk has been mentioned, but there seems a two-fold problem - { Saints } [ Stade Malherbe Saints ] insist he is not for sale and both { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] and { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] seem far more attractive destinations.There was already an angry mood among { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ]'s fans at { Anfield } [ Anfield ], and { Wenger } [ Ars\u00e8ne Wenger ] must decide if he can do something before the deadline to ensure the sort of discontent that undermined them last season does not set in quickly this term.Manchester City did much of their transfer business early but two names on their radar could move before deadline day.City remain in the market for { West Bromwich Albion } [ West Bromwich Albion F.C. ]'s former { Manchester United } [ Manchester United F.C. ] defender { Jonny Evans } [ Jonny Evans ], the 29-year-old rated at \u00a330m by the { Baggies } [ West Bromwich Albion F.C. ].Evans has been outstanding at { The Hawthorns } [ The Hawthorns ] and his no-nonsense defensive style would give { Pep Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ] {'s } [ Manchester City F.C. ] side added steel.

As well as signing his new contract, the { Frenchman } [ France ] acquired { Lacazette } [ Abdelkader Lacazette ] - who appears to have the ability, guile and skill to provide goals - and { Kolasinac } [ Yassine Kolasinac ], who can provide adaptability on the left whatever formation is utilised.However, despite having what appears to be large squad, it seems the Gunners need to do some business. { Oxlade-Chamberlain } [ Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ] is set to join { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] and bids still might come in for the likes of { Sanchez } [ Sanchez (footballer) ]. The defence looks creaky and the group as a whole lacks leadership qualities. Power and fortitude may not be on the medical checklist, but will have to be part of the due diligence which precedes purchases this week.BournemouthKris Temple, BBC Radio SolentBournemouth got the bulk of their transfer business done early in the summer, with the arrivals of { Asmir Begovic } [ Asmir Begovi\u0107 ], { Nathan Ake } [ Nathan Ake ] and { Jermain Defoe } [ Jermain Defoe ] for second spells at the club. They have at least two players genuinely competing for every position, but { Eddie Howe } [ Eddie Howe ] has been a long-time admirer of { Leicester } [ Leicester City F.C. ] winger { Demarai Gray } [ Demarai Gray ], and the rumours of a \u00a325m bid have resurfaced during this window.They are possibly a little short of central-defensive back-up too - if they got an injury in that position they would be stretched for experienced cover.BrightonJohnny Cantor, { BBC Sussex } [ BBC Sussex ]After { FC Zurich } [ FC Z\u00fcrich ] forward { Raphael Dwamena } [ Raphael Dwamena ] failed his medical - and with { Glenn Murray } [ Glenn Murray (footballer) ] and { Sam Baldock } [ Sam Baldock ] out injured - the top priority for { Chris Hughton } [ Chris Hughton ] is at least one striker, but preferably two.

But a new { centre-half } [ Defender (association football) ] and a pacy { forward } [ Forward (association football) ] before the { transfer window } [ Transfer window ] shuts might just be enough to get some brave fans daring to think the heady heights of mid-table might not be entirely beyond them come next May.ChelseaNick Godwin, { BBC Radio London } [ BBC Radio London ]It seems { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] {'s } [ Chelsea F.C. ] decline has been exaggerated.

New recruits { Alvaro Morata } [ \u00c1lvaro Morata ], { Tiemoue Bakayoko } [ Tiemoue Bakayoko ] and { Antonio Rudiger } [ Antonio Rudiger ] have already shown promise.Last season, { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] won the { league } [ Premier League ] with quite a small squad, very few injuries and no { European } [ Europe ] obligations.

The { board } [ Board of directors ] were forced into another { managerial } [ Manager (association football) ] change in the summer, and it took a while to appoint { Frank de Boer } [ Frank de Boer ] {. } [ Frank de Boer ] That may have influenced the Eagles' market moves which have so far brought in two young defenders and on-loan { Ruben Loftus-Cheek } [ Ruben Loftus-Cheek ].It is obvious the { Dutchman } [ Netherlands ] wants to change the style of play at { Selhurst Park } [ Selhurst Park ] and in reality that takes time. Of immediate concern will be to settle on a system, then place round pegs in round holes, then acquire a strong { central defender } [ Defender (association football) ] and another { striker } [ Forward (association football) ] who can provide support and cover for { Christian Benteke } [ Christian Benteke ]. The big-money signings of { Jordan Pickford } [ Jordan Pickford ] and { Michael Keane } [ Michael Keane ] already look like bargains in a hyper-inflated market.Record signing { Gylfi Sigurdsson } [ Gylfi Sigurdsson ] is a proven { Premier League } [ Premier League ] match-winner, and his outrageous effort against { Hajduk Split } [ HNK Hajduk Split ] underlines the goals and sprinkling of stardust he will bring to the team.Davy Klaassen and { Sandro Ramirez } [ Sandro Ram\u00edrez ] have enough of a proven pedigree in the { Netherlands } [ Netherlands ] and { Spain } [ Spain ] respectively to suggest they will bring quality to the squad and { Cuco Martina } [ Cuco Martina ] has looked more than able so far.But there remains a big concern. The acquisition of a central { striker } [ Forward (association football) ] is of paramount importance. Not just to try to replace { Romelu Lukaku } [ Romelu Lukaku ]'s goals but to bring a focal point to { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ] {'s } [ Everton F.C. ] front play that they are lacking.

Just how { head coach } [ Head coach ] { David Wagner } [ David Wagner (American football) ] likes it.LeicesterIan Stringer, { BBC Leicester Sport } [ BBC Leicester ]I'm worried about this transfer window as far as { Leicester City } [ Leicester City F.C. ] are concerned - massive caveat already; their owner is a billionaire, money is not the issue here.If there are genuine bids for { Jamie Vardy } [ Jamie Vardy ] and/or { Danny Drinkwater } [ Danny Drinkwater ] from { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ], then I would not blame the players for being tempted - it is human nature.

Forward { Dominic Solanke } [ Dominic Solanke ] looks an excellent signing and { Andy Robertson } [ Andy Robertson (footballer) ] will bring balance at { left-back } [ Defender (association football) ].Manchester CityAndy Buckley, { BBC Radio Manchester } [ BBC Radio Manchester ] {Manchester City } [ Manchester City F.C. ] fans have liked what they have seen so far from their new signings. Manager { Pep Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ] knew the defence needed strengthening and { Kyle Walker } [ Kyle Walker (footballer) ], { Benjamin Mendy } [ Benjamin Mendy ], { Danilo } [ Danilo (footballer) ] and goalkeeper { Ederson } [ Ederson (footballer) ] have already provided enough evidence to suggest the Blues are much better equipped to mount a sustained domestic and { European } [ Europe ] challenge.Playmaker { Bernardo Silva } [ Bernardo Silva ] is a top-quality { midfielder } [ Midfielder ], and if { Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ] has his way the spending is not yet over. { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] striker { Alexis Sanchez } [ Alexis Sanchez ] has been coveted by the { Spaniard } [ Spain ], who has also done his best to prise { Jonny Evans } [ Jonny Evans ] away from { West Brom } [ West Bromwich Albion F.C. ] as defensive cover. Three of his four targets have not only been acquired, but { Romelu Lukaku } [ Romelu Lukaku ], { Nemanja Matic } [ Nemanja Matic ] and { Victor Lindelof } [ Victor Lindelof ] crucially all arrived before pre-season, allowing them to integrate with their new team-mates.A fourth summer signing - a wide player - now looks unlikely barring a late development after a move for { Ivan Perisic } [ Ivan Perisic ] stalled. But with { Zlatan Ibrahimovic } [ Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 ] returning for the second half of the { season } [ 2012\u201313 Premier League ] after a knee injury, { United } [ Manchester United F.C. ] have a squad ready to challenge for the title again.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNewcastleMatthew Raisbeck, BBC Radio NewcastleAfter winning promotion at the first attempt, { Rafa Benitez } [ Rafa Benitez ] was promised \"every penny the club generates through promotion, player sales and other means\" by owner { Mike Ashley } [ Mike Ashley (businessman) ] in order to strengthen his squad for the { Premier League } [ Premier League ]. But the { Newcastle } [ Newcastle United F.C. ] boss has been left frustrated, confused and unhappy by the club's performance in the transfer market, leading to further speculation about his long-term future.Benitez understands the { Magpies } [ Newcastle United F.C. ] do not have the financial muscle of many of their top-flight rivals but still believed he could bring several quality players to { St James' Park } [ St James' Park ], and went without a summer holiday in order to get some deals ready early. However, the club failed to act, and the { Spaniard } [ Spain ] missed out on most of his top targets, including { Tammy Abraham } [ Tammy Abraham ] and { Willy Caballero } [ Willy Caballero ]. Six signings have been made so far but, as { Benitez } [ Jos\u00e9 Ben\u00edtez ] himself put it recently: \"I am signing the players that I can, not the players that I want.\"He is still looking for a { goalkeeper } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ], a { striker } [ Forward (association football) ], an attacking { midfielder } [ Midfielder ] and a left-sided player - but any new arrivals could be dependent on there being further outgoings before the deadline; there are several fringe players on high salaries { Benitez } [ Jos\u00e9 Ben\u00edtez ] is determined to move on to free up space in the squad and, crucially, generate more funds.SouthamptonAdam Blackmore, { BBC Radio Solent } [ BBC Radio Solent ]A solid if unspectacular start to the season means manager { Mauricio Pellegrino } [ Mauricio Pellegrino ] is dealing with the same issue his predecessor { Claude Puel } [ Claude Puel ] had, namely replacing { Sadio Mane } [ Sadio Mane ].So the window is now about what they would like not what they need - on paper the squad is deeper than it has ever been.But the three signings so far - { Wesley Hoedt } [ Wesley Hoedt ], { Mario Lemina } [ Mario Lemina ], and { Jan Bednarek } [ Jan Bednarek ] - have added strength and backbone, not guile and creativity.Saints need a catalyst to get the best out of { Manolo Gabbiadini } [ Manolo Gabbiadini ], { Charlie Austin } [ Charlie Austin ] and co.The club have made it clear they will not sell defender { Virgil van Dijk } [ Virgil van Dijk ] {, } [ Virgil van Dijk ] or any player they do not want to. Whether they spend more on giving { Pellegrino } [ Clube de Regatas do Pellegrino ] that much-needed dynamism in the final third is doubtful, given the talent already in the camp. But that is what is needed if { Saints } [ Stade Malherbe Saints ] are to push back towards the top six.SwanseaDafydd Pritchard, { BBC Wales Sport } [ BBC Cymru Wales ] {Swansea City } [ Swansea City A.F.C. ]'s summer has been dominated by { Gylfi Sigurdsson } [ Gylfi Sigurdsson ]'s protracted \u00a345m move to { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ].Although it has given the club ample funds to rebuild, there is a perception the { Swans } [ Sydney Swans ] have been slow to act and that last year's { American } [ United States ] takeover has yet to make a significant difference in spending power.Former striker { Wilfried Bony } [ Wilfried Bony ] is expected to rejoin from { Manchester City } [ Manchester City F.C. ] before the window closes, possibly as a replacement for last season's top scorer { Fernando Llorente } [ Fernando Llorente ], a target for { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ].West Brom winger { Nacer Chadli } [ Nacer Chadli ] remains a target, with { Swansea } [ Swansea City A.F.C. ] head coach { Paul Clement } [ Paul Clement (footballer) ] saying he wants at least two new signings in attacking positions.Their other business has been neat if slightly underwhelming, with further changes in midfield seeing { Sam Clucas } [ Sam Clucas ] and { Roque Mesa } [ Roque Mesa ] arriving for a combined \u00a325m or so, and { Jack Cork } [ Jack Cork ] leaving for \u00a310m.There is work to do if { Swansea } [ Swansea City A.F.C. ] are to avoid another relegation battle.StokeGed Scott, { BBC Sport } [ BBC Sport ]After having ninth place (after three successive years) torn from their grasp in May, the summer mood in the { Potteries } [ Potteries ] was not one of great positivity among fans.The loss of { Marko Arnautovic } [ Marko Arnautovi\u0107 ] to { West Ham } [ West Ham United F.C. ] did nothing to persuade many a punter that they might actually be outsiders for relegation.But the re-signing of { Bruno Martins Indi } [ Bruno Martins Indi ], the arrival on loan of fellow defender { Kurt Zouma } [ Kurt Zouma ] from { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ], and the signings of midfielder { Darren Fletcher } [ Darren Fletcher ] and winger { Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting } [ Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting ] have provided a lift.And, when new striker { Jese } [ Jese ] scored the only goal of the game to beat { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] on his debut, the apparent gaps in { Mark Hughes } [ Mark Hughes ]' squad suddenly did not seem quite so glaring.TottenhamNick Godwin, { BBC Radio London } [ BBC Radio London ] {Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] may well have had the best starting XI in the league last season, but depth and the lack of a Plan B remained a problem.The signings of { Davinson Sanchez } [ Davinson S\u00e1nchez ] and { Paulo Gazzaniga } [ Paulo Gazzaniga ] only go some way to address those concerns.There remains intense pressure from fans to recruit a { striker } [ Forward (association football) ], cover at { full-back } [ Defender (association football) ] and a player with the pace or the imagination to change a game.

However, when { Benedict XVI } [ Pope Benedict XVI ] resigned in February 2013, Cardinal { Sodano } [ Pope Sodano ] was 85 and too old to vote, so the senior cardinal-elector, { Giovanni Battista Re } [ Giovanni Battista Re ], takes on the responsibility of administering the oath of secrecy and presiding over the { conclave } [ Papal conclave ]. This includes presiding over daily meetings of { cardinals } [ Cardinal (Catholic Church) ] until the { conclave } [ Papal conclave ] begins.The dean is elected by and from the six cardinal bishops (currently { Cardinal Sodano } [ Benedetto Sodano ], Cardinal Bishop of { Ostia } [ Ostia Antica ] and { Albano } [ Albano Laziale ], Cardinal { Roger Etchegaray } [ Roger Etchegaray ], Cardinal Bishop of { Porto-Santa Rufina } [ Porto-Santa Rufina ], Cardinal { Giovanni Battista Re } [ Giovanni Battista Re ], Cardinal Bishop of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto, Cardinal { Francis Arinze } [ Francis Arinze ], Cardinal Bishop of { Velletri-Segni } [ Velletri-Segni ], Cardinal { Tarcisio Bertone } [ Tarcisio Bertone ], Cardinal Bishop of { Frascati } [ Frascati ], and Cardinal { Jose Saraiva Martins } [ Jos\u00e9 Saraiva Martins ], Cardinal Bishop of { Palestrina } [ Palestrina ]).

This means that a figure in the { poll } [ Opinion poll ] could be up to three { percentage } [ Percentage ] points higher or lower than that shown.Nearly all the final polls are now out. { Ipsos MORI } [ Ipsos MORI ] will publish on Thursday and { ICM } [ International Congress of Mathematicians ] are expected to update their preliminary figures from earlier today. Apart from that, we're there. What should we take from them?First, it's worth making the obvious point that every single poll throughout the campaign has put the { Conservative Party } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] ahead. If { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] receives more votes tomorrow it will be a bigger polling failure than in { 2015 } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] {. } [ Labour Party (UK) ]Second, the range of vote shares for the parties in polls published on Tuesday and Wednesday are { CON } [ Conseil Nacional de Contraintel ] 41-46%, { LAB } [ Liberal Alliance ] 34-40%, { LD } [ Liberal Party (Luxembourg) ] 7-10%, and { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ] 2-5 {%. } [ Percent sign ] Not all the polls separate out the { P } [ Party of Labour (UK) ], { Plaid Cymru } [ Plaid Cymru ] or { Green Party } [ Green Party of England and Wales ].We've looked a lot at the gap between the two top parties - arguably too much. But the polls suggest it could be anywhere between a one and 12-point { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] lead, with { Survation } [ Survation ( polling) ] suggesting the closest result.That suggests anything from a small { swing } [ Swing (politics) ] to { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] to a 2-3% { swing } [ Swing (politics) ] to the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ]. And it's doubly difficult to estimate how that could play out in terms of the number of seats each party wins. So much will depend on variations in different parts of the country and in different types of constituency. There could be no national swing between { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] and { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] but still a significant shift in seats.The { BBC } [ BBC ]/ {ITV } [ ITV (TV network) ]/ {Sky } [ Sky UK ] exit poll will be published at 10pm on Thursday, when polls close. It would be an understatement to say it's eagerly awaited.The final polls in { Scotland } [ Scotland ] suggest a fairly settled picture - although there have only been seven of them during the whole campaign so there's not much to go on. The P are clearly out in front on 40% or a little higher. The { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] and { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] are in a battle for second place at around 25%, perhaps with the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ]' ahead by a nose.In { Wales } [ Wales ] {, } [ YouGov ] { YouGov } [ YouGov ] are the only company to have produced polls throughout the campaign so we have even less evidence. Their last, released on Wednesday, showed little change from the previous two. Plaid Cymru are on 9% with both the { Lib Dems } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] and { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ] on 5 {%. } [ Percentage ]That implies a modest swing to { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] with { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ] losing well over half their { 2015 } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] votes.Three polls have been published since the weekend - by Opinium, { Survation } [ Survation (publisher) ] and { ICM } [ ICM Press ]. None of them showed dramatic changes from what they'd had before.The race is still very close according to { Survation } [ Survation (radio station) ] - their phone poll showed similar figures to their weekend internet poll - but the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] have a handsome lead according to { ICM } [ ICM Research ].Opinium's poll (CON 43, LAB 36, LD 8, { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ] 5, P 5, GRN 2) was their last of the campaign.Lots of other polls are expected today.We should have final figures from ComRes, { ICM } [ International Centre for Management Information ], { Kantar Public } [ Kantar Public ] and { YouGov } [ YouGov ]. Others are possible as well. We'll update the poll tracker as they are released.Ipsos Mori are expected to publish their final figures on Thursday.That won't get added to the { BBC } [ BBC ] poll tracker because of editorial guidelines, which state that no opinion poll on any issue relating to the election can be published on polling day.Get the latest news in your inbox, each weekday morningThe normal array of Saturday night polls have been published - six in total. All of them still have the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] in the lead but by a widely-varying degree. The gap over { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] ranges from just one point in { Survation } [ Survation (newspaper) ]'s poll to 12 points according to { ComRes } [ ComRes ].Clearly, the discrepancies between the polling companies are very large. And that obviously makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.Survation's poll has the narrowest gap of any poll so far during the campaign. It's the only { company } [ Company ] that has not changed its { methodology } [ Methodology ] since 2015. But up to now they've not been especially favourable to { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] {. } [ Labour Party (UK) ]Their poll was conducted today, after last night's { Question Time } [ Question Time (TV programme) ] special, where { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] and { Jeremy Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ] faced questions from a live audience. And they found that more people who watched the programme said it made them more likely to vote { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] than { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ].It's very unclear whether this could really have caused a significant shift though. A further complication is that most of { Survation } [ Survation (magazine) ]'s polls in this campaign have been conducted by phone. This was an { internet } [ Internet ] poll so it makes comparisons with their previous figures harder. { In } [ Inch ] addition to the voting intention numbers {, } [ Inch ] they reported a dramatic change { in } [ Inch ] attitudes towards the two main { party } [ Political party ] leaders {. } [ Party ]Since she became { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ] {, } [ Theresa May ] { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] has always enjoyed positive approval figures - more people have said that they are satisfied with her performance than dissatisfied.Meanwhile, { Jeremy Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ] {'s } [ Labour Party (UK) ] rating has shot up. He's still in negative territory and, on -11%, still behind { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ]. But that contrasts with -41% in March, before the election was called.Other pollsters have seen a similar trend. ComRes have also reported { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ]'s first negative negative rating (-3%). Opinium put { Jeremy Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ] on -12%, up from -35% at the start of the campaign.For { ORB } [ Orb ] tonight's poll will be their last of the campaign. Their final figures are { CON } [ Northern Ireland ] 45%, { LAB } [ Labour Party (UK) ] 36%, { LD } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] 8% and { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ] 4 {%. } [ Percentage ]Other companies will be publishing further polls in the final week of the campaign though. YouGov have also been updating their seat projection - that should also continue in the coming days.After their striking seat projection published last night, { YouGov } [ YouGov ] has a new poll this evening which has the narrowest gap between the main two parties so far during the campaign. It has the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] on 42% and { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] on 39% - their highest rating in any poll since { 2014 } [ 2014 United Kingdom general election ].It's not all good news for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] though. { Kantar Public } [ Kantar Public ] also published a { poll } [ Opinion poll ] on Wednesday with a slightly increased { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] lead compared to their previous { poll } [ Opinion poll ]. They now have the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] on 43% and { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] on 33 {%. } [ Percentage ]Its not the only { company } [ Company ] which still shows a large gap. In fact, it's more than 10% according to { ICM } [ International Congress of Mathematicians ] and ComRes.The main reason for this disparity is the different ways that the pollsters estimate turnout.Polling companies are sometimes accused of \"herding\" - manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. Nobody could accuse them of that at this election. If anything, the differences have become more stark as we approach election day.ScotlandThere was also a rare { Scottish } [ Scotland ] poll published on Wednesday afternoon. { The P } [ The P ], on 43%, maintained the commanding lead that they've had throughout the campaign and for a long time before that. More interesting was that { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] and the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] were on level pegging at 25 {%. } [ Percentage ] That's the first time this year that the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party of Canada ] haven't been in a clear second place.As with the other nations, though, it's hard to draw conclusions when there have been so few polls.The { polls } [ Opinion poll ] covered in the { BBC } [ BBC ] tracker are standard voting intention { polls } [ Opinion poll ]. That is, they try to gauge levels of support for each of the { parties } [ Political party ] across the { country } [ Country ]. They do not attempt to say how many seats each party would win.There's a good reason for that.The { first-past-the-post } [ First-past-the-post voting ] { electoral system } [ Electoral system ] means that there is no straightforward relationship between votes and seats won.The 2017 election could be almost a repeat of the { 2015 } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] result in terms of vote share but produce a very different outcome in terms of the number of { MPs } [ Member of parliament ] returned for each party.Clearly, though, people are interested in knowing how { votes } [ Voting ] might translate into { seats } [ Seat ] {. } [ Seat ]So { YouGov } [ YouGov ] have attempted to model how that could work. Their projection of a { hung parliament } [ Hung parliament ] has, understandably, caused a stir.The { model } [ Mathematical model ] used to make this { projection } [ Map projection ] is complicated.It's not based on a single { poll } [ Opinion poll ], but on the responses of 50,000 { people } [ People (magazine) ] who have taken part in other { YouGov } [ YouGov ] polls. Nor does it work by just counting up how the respondents in each { constituency } [ Electoral district ] said they would vote.Even with 50,000 people there wouldn't be nearly enough to have a reliable sample in each of the 650 { constituencies } [ Electoral district ] in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] {. } [ United Kingdom ]Instead, it uses { demographic } [ Demography ] information about the people who take part in the { polls } [ Opinion poll ], as well as information about where they live and how they've voted before, to try to work out how different types of people are likely to vote.Then it looks at the { demographic } [ Demography ] make-up of each { constituency } [ Electoral district ] and comes up with an { estimate } [ Estimation ] of the likely outcome.YouGov themselves have indicated that their projection is subject to quite a lot of uncertainty.And Stefan Shakespeare, the company's Chief Executive, has said that it would only take a small shift in favour of the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] to see them win a healthy { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] majority.So it should definitely be treated with caution.Wales updateThere's been no shortage of { Britain-wide } [ United Kingdom ] polls but in the individual nations it's a different story.With so few polls focused on the election in { Scotland } [ Scotland ], { Wales } [ Wales ] or { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] it's impossible to identify any well-supported trends.That said, there has been one { Welsh } [ Wales ] poll since I last mentioned them which showed a very different picture from the two that had gone before.YouGov gave { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] a 10 point lead in { Wales } [ Wales ] whereas previously they'd shown a clear { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] advantage.The direction of shift is consistent with what we've seen in the national polls but it's very difficult to know what to make of the particular numbers. It's a huge turnaround and we really would need more evidence before drawing any firm conclusions.Five polls have been published this evening. Overall, they reinforce Thursday night's polls which suggested that the { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] lead over { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] has shrunk again since last weekend but there are quite large differences between the pollsters' figures.ICM and ComRes have a larger gap between the two main parties than the other companies. They put it at 14% and 12% respectively but that's still down from what they were showing two weeks ago.There will no doubt be some talk about the fact that { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] has dropped two points in { YouGov } [ YouGov ] {'s } [ YouGov ] poll compared to the one they published on Thursday. But that still means that the gap is narrower than they found last weekend and it would be unwise to read too much into a small change between two individual polls.The general trend is clear. The { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] are still ahead but { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] has closed the gap.Is the shift believable?The godfather of { psephology } [ Psephology ] or the study of elections, Sir { David Butler } [ David Butler (psephologist) ], said this week that the movement in the polls over this campaign is bigger than in any election he's covered since 1945. But many experts think that { election } [ Election ] campaigns don't make much difference - { voters } [ Voting ]' views are set years or months before { polling } [ Polling place ] day.So does that mean the { polls } [ Opinion poll ] must be wrong? Not necessarily. Voters have become much more volatile than they used to be - much less loyal to a single party.Chris Prosser and Jane Green from the British Election Study have shown that over the last 50 years the proportion of voters who switch parties between elections has risen from around 15% in the 1960s and 1970s to 43% in 2015.We can't be sure that the same will happen this time and many of the people who do switch might have made up their minds before the campaign started. It's also possible that people who said they were going to switch at the start of the campaign have gone back to the party they supported before.But if voters are more likely to change allegiance than in the past then perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised if the polls show large movements.A big part of the problem with the polls in 2015 was that they failed to estimate accurately the difference in { turnout } [ Voter turnout ] rates among different groups of voters. In particular, they underestimated the turnout gap between { young } [ Youth ] and { old } [ Old age ] voters.As I've mentioned before, many of the pollsters have adjusted their methods to try to overcome this problem.But concerns remain about whether the people who say they'll vote { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] will actually do so on 8 June. If they don't then { Labour } [ New Zealand Labour Party ] {'s } [ New Zealand Labour Party ] vote share could be lower than the polls suggest.Two new polls published on Thursday night suggest a further continuation of the trend we've seen throughout the campaign so far. The gap between the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] and { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] has narrowed again. It's down to eight points in { Kantar Public } [ Kantar Public ] {'s } [ Kantar Public ] poll and just five points in { YouGov } [ YouGov ] {'s } [ YouGov ] - smaller than the actual gap between the parties at the { 2015 election } [ 2015 Australian federal election ].The { Manchester } [ Manchester ] attack has, rightly, meant that the country's attention has been focused away from the { election } [ 2016 United Kingdom general election ]. But as the { campaign } [ Political campaign ] resumes, it's inevitable that people will ask whether it's had an effect on how people might vote.That doesn't mean we can say that the latest shift is related to the attack.Theresa May has consistently had a strong lead over { Jeremy Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ] on the issues of { defence } [ Military ] and { security } [ Security ]. That hasn't changed. YouGov found that 55% of respondents trusted { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] to make the right decisions to keep { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] safe from terrorism compared to just 33% who trusted { Jeremy Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ].It's possible that the polls are still reacting to the fallout of the { manifesto } [ Manifesto ] launches last week - and the revisions to the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ]' social care plans announced on Monday (they denied it was a U-turn). There could also just be an element of natural polling variation.Whatever the cause, the important thing to remember is to look at the general trend rather than concentrating too much on individual polls. The { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] retain a clear lead over { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] but the gap has closed significantly.After the week of the { manifesto } [ Manifesto ] launches for the main GB-wide parties, the trend of { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] improvement that we've seen throughout the campaign is continuing.In fact, four polls released on Saturday, for the Sunday papers, suggest that the { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] advance has strengthened. And, while the { Lib Dems } [ Liberal Democrats (UK) ] and { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ] are still below where they were when the election was announced, for the first time it looks as though the latest { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] rise is coming at the expense of the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ].The { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] lead was generally around 20 points or a little above in the middle of April. It's down to between 9 and 13 points in today's polls.As ever, the figures should be treated with caution. It's particularly worth noting that none of the most recent polls come from the companies that tend to put { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] on a lower figure.ICM and { Kantar Public } [ Kantar Public ] both make adjustments based on { turnout } [ Voter turnout ] rates for different groups of people at previous { elections } [ Election ]. They've had { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] at a lower level than some of the other companies throughout the campaign. So it will be interesting to see whether their next polls follow a similar pattern.Looking beneath the voting intention figures there are some clues about what might be causing the shift towards { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] that we've seen.One is voters' responses to the manifestos. For example, { Survation } [ Survation (marketing) ] found that nearly half of respondents opposed { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] plans for changes to the system of funding for { social care } [ Social work ]. By contrast, { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] {'s } [ Labour Party (UK) ] plan to increase income tax for people earning over { \u00c2\u00a3 } [ Pound sterling ]80,000 was backed by more than six out of ten people and opposed by under a quarter.Jeremy { Corbyn } [ Jeremy Corbyn ] has also seen an improvement in his approval ratings although he still lags a long way behind { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ]. For example, { Opinium } [ Opinium Sports ] have him on a net figure of -18 this week, up from -28 last week.Despite the significant moves we should still remember that the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] retain a large lead by historical standards.If today's polls were repeating on 8 June it would be the biggest gap between the two parties since { Tony Blair } [ Tony Blair ]'s landslide in { 1997 } [ 1997 United Kingdom general election ] in terms of share of the vote.There's also some evidence in the polls that the { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] vote is \"softer\" than the { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] vote. In other words, more { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] voters than { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] voters say they might change their minds.Four polls over the weekend reinforced the picture of a { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] improvement during the course of the campaign so far. ORB, Opinium, ComRes and { YouGov } [ YouGov ] all had them at 30% or above - clearly above the levels seen at around the time the election was announced.However, this increase has not come at the expense of the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] who remain in the mid-to-high 40s with a commanding lead.The main losers have been { UKIP } [ UK Independence Party ], who are down in the 3-6% range.If the current polls were reflected in the final result it would mean the two main parties between them capturing a significantly larger share of the vote than at recent elections.You have to go back to { 1992 } [ 1992 Leeds City Council election ] to find an election where the total { Conservative } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] and { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ] share was close to that - the figure was 78 {%. } [ Percentage ] The last time it was above 80% was 1979.All the polls shown in the tracker report vote intention share across { Great Britain } [ Great Britain ], but that's not very helpful for working out what's going on in parts of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] where other parties stand.However as we've only seen two campaign polls in { Scotland } [ Scotland ], two in { Wales } [ Wales ] and one in { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ] so far, there's not very much evidence to go on.Having said that, both of the { Scottish } [ Scotland ] polls, conducted by { Survation } [ Survation ( poll) ] and { YouGov } [ YouGov ], have given the P over 40% with a clear lead over the { Conservatives } [ Scottish Conservatives ] on 28% and { Labour } [ Scottish Labour Party ] down in third place on 18 {%. } [ Percentage ]In { Wales } [ Wales ], two { YouGov } [ YouGov ] polls have put the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] ahead of { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ], but with a smaller gap than across { Britain } [ United Kingdom ] as a whole.Like in the { national polls } [ United Kingdom ], { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ]'s share has seen an improvement from the beginning of the campaign. { Plaid Cymru } [ Plaid Cymru ] are back in third placeIn { Northern Ireland } [ Northern Ireland ], the single Lucid Talk poll gave the { DUP } [ Democratic Unionist Party ] a narrow lead over { Sinn Fein } [ Sinn F\u00e9in ] with the { UUP } [ United Kingdom Party ], { SDLP } [ Social Democratic and Labour Party ] and the { Alliance } [ Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ] all some way back.As well as asking people which { party } [ Political party ] they intend to vote for, { pollsters } [ Opinion poll ] also ask which issues are the most important. In 2015 the three biggest issues were the { NHS } [ National Health Service (England) ], { immigration } [ Immigration ] and the { economy } [ Economy ].A significant change at this election is the emergence of { Brexit } [ Brexit ] {. } [ Brexit ] Polls conducted since the election was called have put it at the top of the list of important issues ahead of the { NHS } [ National Health Service ] in second place with the { economy } [ Economy ] and { immigration } [ Immigration ] battling it out for third.This may help to explain, at least in part, the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ]' lead in the polls.So far as we can tell, they've managed to attract the support of a large number of new voters who backed leave at last year's { referendum } [ Referendum ] whilst holding on to most of their own supporters who backed remain - many of whom now think that the { Government } [ Government of the Republic of Ireland ] has a duty to implement the outcome of the { referendum } [ Referendum ].As everybody knows, the polls got the { 2015 } [ 2015 United Kingdom general election ] general election wrong.They suggested that the likely outcome was a { hung parliament } [ Hung parliament ] but, as we know, the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] won an overall majority. So is it worth paying attention to them this time?Well, we certainly shouldn't assume that the result will be exactly what the polls say. But that doesn't mean they're completely useless.For one thing, { critics } [ Critic ] have perhaps exaggerated other polling \"disasters\".The belief that the polls were just as bad at the { EU referendum } [ 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum ] and in the { US Presidential election } [ 2016 United States presidential election ] is widely held. However, whilst some polls gave a misleading picture at the { referendum } [ Referendum ], others were pretty close.We reported at the time that the polls overall indicated a very narrow race in the weeks running up to referendum day.Similarly, at the { US } [ United States ] election, the national polls weren't that far off in terms of the share of the vote won by { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] and { Hilary Clinton } [ Hilary Clinton ] - { Clinton } [ Hilary Clinton ] actually won the popular vote by over 2 {%. } [ Percentage ]It was state polls that were unreliable and led to a misleading impression as to who would emerge from the { Electoral College } [ United States Electoral College ] system as { president } [ President of the United States ].In both cases, if all we'd taken from the polls was that the votes would be close, we would have been on the right lines.The polling companies have also made adjustments to try to prevent the problems of 2015 from happening again and to resolve issues that arose at the referendum.These methodological changes vary from pollster to pollster but there are some general trends.Several of them now ask the people who take part about their educational background. The aim, as with questions about { class } [ Social class ], { age } [ Ageing ], { gender } [ Gender ] and { region } [ Region ] is to get a sample of people who are representative of the population as a whole.Others have developed more sophisticated ways to estimate how likely it is that somebody who takes part in a { poll } [ Opinion poll ] will actually vote. Just asking { people } [ People ] whether they will { vote } [ Voting ] is not a good guide.Of course, we can't be sure whether these adjustments will make the polls more accurate. So some { people } [ People ] will no doubt decide to ignore them all together.But there's still clearly an appetite for them.No fewer than 30 have been conducted since the { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Singapore ] made her surprise announcement on 18 April.That's more than one a day.General election: What you need to knowIt's now three weeks since the election was announced and the official campaign is well under way.After { Theresa May } [ Theresa May ] {'s } [ Theresa May ] surprise statement, the { Conservatives } [ Conservative Party (UK) ] saw their poll rating jump with several polls suggesting a comfortable 20 point lead.Since then, nothing very dramatic has happened. There has been a modest uptick for { Labour } [ Labour Party (UK) ], who are generally up to the high 20s or around 30 - up from the mid 20s just after the announcement.But that still leaves a very large gap between the main two parties.UKIP seem to have slipped a little further down and perhaps the Lib Dems have also fallen back a bit, although these trends are not clear.Most opinion polls, and all of the ones covered in the { BBC } [ BBC ] poll tracker, are either conducted by { telephone } [ Telephone ] or { online } [ Online and offline ].For phone polls the polling company rings up { landline } [ Landline ] and { mobile } [ Mobile phone ] numbers.In principle, anyone with a { phone } [ Telephone ] could be asked to participate.For { internet } [ Internet ] { polls } [ Opinion poll ], the company maintains a panel of people who are prepared to take part. For each { poll } [ Opinion poll ] they will contact the required number of { panel } [ Panel (science) ] members.In both cases the company will aim to survey a sample of people who are representative of the country as a whole - in terms of age, { gender } [ Gender ], { social class } [ Social class ], etc.They will generally then apply weighting adjustments if one or other { group } [ Social group ] is over-represented or under-represented in their { sample } [ Sample (statistics) ].It's also common to seek a representative { sample } [ Sample (statistics) ] or apply a { weighting } [ Weighting ] based on past-voting behaviour.Polls included: All polls conducted by companies which are members of the { British Polling Council } [ British Polling Council ].

They have got the players and there are no obvious weaknesses in the team other than in the centre of midfield, where they are missing { Santi Cazorla } [ Santi Cazorla ].The { Spaniard } [ Spain ] makes them tick - but they are not going to sign someone to replace him when he will be back from injury in a couple of months.Linked with (Player, age, position and club): { Dimitri Payet } [ Dimitri Payet ], 29, CM ( {West Ham United } [ West Ham United F.C. ]), { Jordan Pickford } [ Jordan Pickford ], 22, GK ( {Sunderland } [ Sunderland A.F.C. ]), { Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang } [ Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ], 27, CF( {Borussia Dortmund } [ Borussia Dortmund ]), { Isco } [ Isco ], 24, CM ( {Real Madrid } [ Real Madrid C.F. ]), { Guillaume Hubert } [ Guillaume Hubert ], 22, GK ( {Standard Liege } [ Standard Li\u00e8ge ]), { Kostas Manolas } [ Kostas Manolas ], 25, CB ( {Roma } [ A.S.

They have still got quite a bit of work to do at the back, but they are an improving team who are looking up rather than down the table.Linked with (Player, age, position and club): { Nathan Ake } [ Nathan Ake ], 21, CB ( {Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ]) - permanent deal, { Conor Chaplin } [ Conor Chaplin ], 19, CF ( {Portsmouth } [ Portsmouth F.C. ]).Stat attack: { Burnley } [ Burnley F.C. ] have the highest tackling success rate of 76.4% but have faced the most shots on target (113) and, between them, their goalkeepers have saved the most shots as well (84).Window shopping: Signing { Joey Barton } [ Joey Barton ] makes sense. He played under { Sean Dyche } [ Sean Dyche ] last { season } [ 2013\u201314 Premier League ] and they have got a good relationship. Dyche knows what { Barton } [ Paul Barton (footballer) ] is like in the dressing room and how to handle him, so it is a no-brainer really.That deal obviously depends on any ban the { midfielder } [ Midfielder ] gets over his { betting } [ Gambling ] charges.  I imagine his { contract } [ Contract ] will be designed so that if he gets a 20-game ban, then there will no longer be a { contract } [ Contract ].I would understand if { Dyche } [ Anthony Dyche ] brought in a couple of other players, but they are not going to be signings that will blow anyone out of the water.For starters, he will not risk upsetting the spirit of the squad because that is one of their major strengths - and { Burnley } [ Burnley F.C. ] are also not going to break the bank to try to stay up.Linked with (Player, age, position and club): { Luciano Narsingh } [ Luciano Narsingh ], 26, FW ( {PSV Eindhoven } [ PSV Eindhoven ]), { Marc Roberts } [ Marc Roberts (footballer) ], 26, CB ( {Barnsley } [ Barnsley F.C. ]), { Jordan Rhodes } [ Jordan Rhodes ], 26, CF ( {Middlesbrough } [ Middlesbrough F.C. ]).Stat attack: { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] have conceded the fewest goals (11) and have kept more clean sheets (11) than any other team in their first 18 games. Blues boss { Antonio Conte } [ Antonio Conte ] has made the fewest changes to his starting XIs than any other { Premier League } [ Premier League ] manager - just 15 since the start of the { season } [ 2015\u201316 Premier League ].Window shopping: { Belgium } [ Belgium ] striker { Michy Batshuayi } [ Michy Batshuayi ] joined for \u00a333m in the summer but is obviously not ready as far as { Conte } [ Antonio Conte ] is concerned. Whether the { Italian } [ Italy ] thinks the 23-year-old will be ready soon is unclear, but the fact he left him out when { Diego Costa } [ Diego Costa ] was suspended against { Bournemouth } [ A.F.C. Bournemouth ] said a lot.Up front is the only area where { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] look a bit short. I don't think they will sign anyone, but if they do it might be similar to when { Manchester United } [ Manchester United F.C. ] signed { Henrik Larsson } [ Henrik Larsson ] at the age of 35 during the 2006-07 season.By that I mean an experienced { striker } [ Forward (association football) ] who would get them goals in the short-term. I don't know who the 2017 version of { Larsson } [ Henrik Larsson ] would be, or whether they could get him, but that is the type of player they might be after.I don't see any other weaknesses in their squad. { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] boss { Jurgen Klopp } [ Jurgen Klopp ] was right when he said recently that { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ]'s best players have remained free of injuries so far, but they have got cover and they would have to have quite a few injuries to affect them badly.For example, { Willian } [ Willian (footballer) ] can come into the regular trio of attacking midfielders, { Cesc Fabregas } [ Cesc Fabregas ] replaces { Nemanja Matic } [ Nemanja Matic ] or { N'Golo Kante } [ N'Golo Kante ] when they are not available and { John Terry } [ John Terry ] and { Kurt Zouma } [ Kurt Zouma ] back up the back three.Linked with (Player, age, position and club): { James Rodriguez } [ James Rodriguez (footballer) ], 25, FW ( {Real Madrid } [ Real Madrid C.F. ]), { Diego Laxalt } [ Diego Laxalt ], 23, CM ( {Genoa } [ Genoa C.F.C. ]), { Dimitri Payet } [ Dimitri Payet ], 29, CM ( {West Ham United } [ West Ham United F.C. ]), { Radja Nainggolan } [ Radja Nainggolan ], 28, CM ( {Roma } [ A.S.

He is very good at finding players from outside the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] {, } [ England ] so I don't necessarily think it will be a case of him signing people who have played under him before.Generally, { Allardyce } [ Lee Allardyce ] works from the back and then moves up the pitch.Palace did not always have a natural holding midfielder in their team under { Alan Pardew } [ Alan Pardew ] - { Mile Jedinak } [ Mile Jedinak ] was sold to { Aston Villa } [ Aston Villa F.C. ], { Joe Ledley } [ Joe Ledley ] has not always played and { Yohan Cabaye } [ Yohan Cabaye ] is not that sort of player. I think that position will also be one of { Allardyce } [ Jamie Allardyce ]'s priorities.Linked with (Player, age, position and club): { Kieran Gibbs } [ Kieran Gibbs ], 27, LB ( {Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ]), { Lucas Lima } [ Lucas Lima ], 26, CM ( {Santos } [ Santos FC ]), { Aleksandar Mitrovic } [ Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 ], 22, CF ( {Newcastle United } [ Newcastle United F.C. ]), { Jermain Defoe } [ Jermain Defoe ], 34, CF, ( {Sunderland } [ Sunderland A.F.C. ]).Stat attack: Plenty of shots on target, but not many goals. Everton have the third-best shooting accuracy - 48.9% - but their shot-conversion rate of 13.5% is only the 13th best.Window shopping: Teenage forward { Ademola Lookman } [ Ademola Lookman ] is on his way from { Charlton } [ Charlton Athletic F.C. ] and that will only be the start. I think they will do quite a bit of business in every area of the team.I can see them being one of the busier teams and their manager { Ronald Koeman } [ Ronald Koeman ] will do as much as he can.The { Dutchman } [ Dutch people ] will have money to spend too.

On top of that they have the best shooting accuracy of 51.57% and the highest shot-conversion rate of 20.Window shopping: They need a left-back, although I am not sure they will do anything about it.James { Milner } [ James Milner ] has done really well since being asked to play there but they need an alternative because it will be a long season. { Alberto Moreno } [ Alberto Moreno ] can come in and play, but you cannot trust him. If { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] got a young player who is not ready to play there every week, that could be the answer.There is also some talk about them selling { Daniel Sturridge } [ Daniel Sturridge ] in January, but why would you weaken your attack and make another team stronger? { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] know what he can do and they should keep him.Linked with (Player, age, position and club): { Quincy Promes } [ Quincy Promes ], 24, RM ( {Spartak Moscow } [ FC Spartak Moscow ]), { Kasper Schmeichel } [ Kasper Schmeichel ], 30, GK ( {Leicester City } [ Leicester City F.C. ]), { Thiago Maia } [ Thiago Maia ], 19, CM ( {Santos } [ Santos FC ]), { Gabriel Barbosa } [ Gabriel Barbosa ], 20, CF ( {Inter Milan } [ Inter Milan ]), { Franck Kessie } [ Franck Kessie ], 20, CM ( {Atalanta } [ Atalanta B.C. ]), { Gregoire Defrel } [ Gregoire Defrel ], 25, CF ( {Sassuolo } [ U.S. Sassuolo Calcio ]), { Moussa Dembele } [ Moussa Dembele ], 20, CF ( {Celtic } [ Celtic F.C. ]), { Jamaal Lascelles } [ Jamaal Lascelles ], 23, CB ( {Newcastle } [ Newcastle United F.C. ]), { Javier Hernandez } [ Javier Hern\u00e1ndez ], 28, CF ( {Bayer Leverkusen } [ Bayer 04 Leverkusen ]), { Christian Pulisic } [ Christian Pulisic ], 18, LM ( {Borussia Dortmund } [ Borussia Dortmund ]), { Virgil van Dijk } [ Virgil van Dijk ], 25, CB ( {Southampton } [ Southampton F.C. ]), { Lorenzo Insigne } [ Lorenzo Insigne ], 25, FW ( {Napoli } [ S.S.C.

He held the batting line-up together in { 2012 } [ 2012 County Championship ] and has shown in his previous three spells with the county that a good overseas signing can have a huge beneficial impact, both on and off the pitch.By { BBC Radio Lancashire } [ BBC Radio Lancashire ]'s { Scott Read } [ Scott Read (journalist) ]Captain: { Ramnaresh Sarwan } [ Ramnaresh Sarwan ] (Championship), { Josh Cobb } [ Josh Cobb ] (one-day)Overseas players: { Ranmnaresh Sarwan } [ Ranmnaresh Sarwan ] ( {West Indies } [ West Indies cricket team ]), { Shakib Al Hasan } [ Shakib Al Hasan ] ( {Bangladesh } [ Bangladesh national cricket team ], for FL t20), { Joe Burns } [ Joe Burns (cricketer) ] ( {Australia } [ Australia national cricket team ], for FL t20)How they did last season: Seventh in { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division Two 2, sixth in CB40 group, bottom of T20 group.Season prospects: The outlook is brighter than in previous seasons, with some strong additions in the winter. Niall O'Brien could be the missing link in the top order and the emergence of { Shiv Thakor } [ Shiv Thakor ] provides more encouragement for supporters. However, they need a fit { Matthew Hoggard } [ Matthew Hoggard ] to compete in the { County Championship } [ County Championship ] and, after two barren and injury-filled years, it is time for { Nathan Buck } [ Nathan Buck ] to deliver on his promise. Josh Cobb leads the team in all one-day { cricket } [ Cricket ] and expect better this season, with { Shakib Al-Hasan } [ Shakib Al-Hasan ] an exciting signing to help give a more youthful and energetic feel to the shorter forms of the game.One to watch: { Joe Burns } [ Joe Burns (cricketer) ], the { Queensland } [ Queensland cricket team ] batsman who replaces { Sarwan } [ Mohammad Sarwan ] in May, will be keen to show the { Australia } [ Australia national cricket team ] selectors his abilities in an { Ashes } [ The Ashes ] summer, and { James Sykes } [ James Sykes (cricketer) ] the left-arm spinner, who will try and take on the role from { Claude Henderson } [ Claude Henderson (cricketer) ]. Sykes has a nice action, turns it and has steady control.Season prospects: { Middlesex } [ Middlesex County F.C. ] could not have hoped for a better outcome last season on their return to { Division One } [ EFL League One ] {. } [ Middlesex County Cricket Club ] Whether they can go even further this year will depend greatly on the consistency of their middle-order batting. The top three of { Joe Denly } [ Joe Denly ], { Sam Robson } [ Sam Robson ] and { Chris Rogers } [ Chris Rogers (cricketer) ] can be relied upon to offer a solid foundation at the top, while the depth of the bowling attack has been strengthened by the outstanding addition of { James Harris } [ James Harris (cricketer) ] from { Glamorgan } [ Glamorgan County Cricket Club ]. They have struggled in { T20 } [ Twenty20 ] { cricket } [ Cricket ] in recent years and this is an area the { county } [ County cricket ] will be desperate to improve in.One to watch: { Toby Roland-Jones } [ Toby Roland-Jones ] has performed with astonishing consistency since his relatively late debut. The emergence of the naggingly accurate seamer has helped to fill very big boots, now that { Steven Finn } [ Steven Finn ] is established in the { England } [ England ] side. With the ever-reliable { Tim Murtagh } [ Tim Murtagh ], the new recruit Harris and the occasional glimpse of { Steven Finn } [ Steven Finn ], along with all-rounder { Gareth Berg } [ Gareth Berg ], { Middlesex } [ Middlesex County Cricket Club ] will have arguably the most feared bowling attack in the country.9's Kevin HandCaptain: Stephen Peters (Championship), Alex Wakely (YB40 and T20)Overseas players: { Trent Copeland } [ Trent Copeland ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ], until 8 June), { Cameron White } [ Cameron White ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ], for Twenty20)How they did last season: Eighth in { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division Two, sixth in CB40 Group C and sixth in FLt20 Midlands/Wales/West Group.Season prospects: A truly dismal showing in 2012, particularly in white-ball cricket, prompted an honest appraisal, led by chief executive { David Smith } [ David Smith (cricketer, born 1965) ] and first-team coach { David Ripley } [ David Ripley ], of where the county are now and what they want to be in the future. Matthew Spriegel and { Steven Crook } [ Steven Crook ] have been signed to bolster a predominantly young squad, with much hoped of { Rob Newton } [ Rob Newton ], { David Willey } [ David Willey (footballer) ], { Ben Duckett } [ Ben Duckett ] and { Ollie Stone } [ Ollie Stone ]. Ripley's top priority is to be competitive in all forms of the game, and a run to { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ] finals day would please both supporters and the holders of the purse strings.One to watch: Fast bowler { Ollie Stone } [ Ollie Stone ] impressed good judges with his pace and control last season and captained { England } [ England ] Under-19s in { South Africa } [ South Africa ] during the winter. Only 19, he will need some careful handling, but if the { Norfolk } [ Norfolk ]-born prospect stays fit, he could make a major impact.By BBC Radio Northampton's Andrew RaddCaptain: { Chris Read } [ Chris Read ]Overseas players: { Ed Cowan } [ Ed Cowan ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ], start of season), { David Hussey } [ David Hussey ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ], from June, including { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ])How they did last season: Fifth in { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division One, fourth in { CB40 } [ ECB 40 ] group, FL t20 quarter-finalistsSeason prospects: { Nottinghamshire } [ Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club ]'s strength in depth was severely tested towards the end of the 2012 campaign, with six players being called away for { England } [ England cricket team ] duty. While the likelihood is that the international calendar will again cause clashes with the domestic programme, director of { cricket } [ Cricket ] { Mick Newell } [ Mick Newell ] believes his squad is better equipped to withstand occasional absenteeism from his star names. The { bookmakers } [ Bookmaker ] agree, listing { Notts } [ Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club ] as second favourites for both the { County Championship } [ County Championship ] and the { T20 } [ Twenty20 ]. His first season at { Trent Bridge } [ Trent Bridge ] could not have gone much better, with 971 { first-class } [ First-class cricket ] runs, despite missing the last two matches, and a prolific white-ball season, which saw him restored to the { England } [ England cricket team ] { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ] side before becoming the leading scorer in last October's { Champions League } [ Champions League Cricket ]. More of the same is expected in { 2013 } [ 2013 in film ] {. } [ 2013 in film ]By { BBC Radio Nottingham } [ BBC Radio Nottingham ] {'s } [ BBC Radio Nottingham ] { Dave Bracegirdle } [ Dave Bracegirdle ]Captain: { Marcus Trescothick } [ Marcus Trescothick ].Overseas players: { Alviro Petersen } [ Alviro Petersen ] (for first half of season and FL t20), Abdur Rehman (five Championship games and possibly FL t20).How they did last season: Second in the { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division One, third in { CB40 } [ ECB 40 ] group, losing semi-finalists in { FL t20 } [ Twenty20 Cup ].Season prospects: Falling at the final hurdle has become something of a problem for { Somerset } [ Somerset County Cricket Club ] in recent seasons and their 'bridesmaid' reputation led to { Brian Rose } [ Brian Rose (cricketer) ] stepping down as director of cricket. His replacement is { Dave Nosworthy } [ Dave Nosworthy ] and the county are hoping a fresh approach may be the missing piece in their trophy puzzle. The likely absence, on { England } [ England ] duty, of { Nick Compton } [ Nick Compton ] for much of the { Championship } [ EFL Championship ] season will be a blow, but if they can avoid the injuries which blighted them last year, a squad including { Marcus Trescothick } [ Marcus Trescothick ], { Jos Buttler } [ Jos Buttler ], { Pete Trego } [ Pete Trego ], { Craig Kieswetter } [ Craig Kieswetter ], { Alfonso Thomas } [ Alfonso Thomas ] and { Steve Kirby } [ Steve Kirby ] has plenty to offer.One to watch: The { Overton } [ Craig Overton ] twins, { Craig } [ Craig Overton ] and { Jamie } [ Jamie Overton ], and { Craig Meschede } [ Craig Meschede ] were just three of the club's youngsters to make a mark last season, but 20-year-old { Ireland } [ Republic of Ireland ] spinner { George Dockrell } [ George Dockrell ] took 34 wickets { Championship } [ County Championship ] wickets in just 10 matches and will hope to better that if he avoids injury.By BBC Radio Bristol's Ed HadwinCaptain: { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith ]Overseas players: { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith ] ( {South Africa } [ South Africa ]); { Ricky Ponting } [ Ricky Ponting ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ], while Smith is at { Champions Trophy } [ ICC Champions Trophy ])How they did last season: Seventh in { Championship Division One } [ EFL Championship ], second in CB 40 group, sixth in FL t20 group.Season prospects: After a difficult { 2012 } [ 2012\u201313 in English cricket ], { Surrey } [ Surrey County Cricket Club ] have recruited well over the winter and the signing of { Graeme Smith } [ Graeme Smith ] is one that has caught the imagination. Smith will bring his leadership and experience to the dressing room and plenty of runs to the top of the order.  { Vikram Solanki } [ Vikram Solanki ] and { Gary Keedy } [ Gary Keedy ] are shrewd signings and both will play a major role this year. The bowling unit looks very strong, with all bases covered, and the likes of { Rory Burns } [ Rory Burns ] and { Arun Harinath } [ Arun Harinath ] will want to build on an excellent 2012, in which both scored maiden Championship centuries - and a certain { Ricky Ponting } [ Ricky Ponting ] will play for { Surrey } [ Surrey County Cricket Club ] in June and July. They look to have a balanced squad and will want to make an impact in all three competitions.One to watch: I'm going for two, { Rory Burns } [ Rory Burns ] and { Arun Harinath } [ Arun Harinath ]. Burns seized his opportunity last year at the top of the order and scored his runs in a stylish and attractive manner. Burns will be looking to forge a successful partnership with Smith and learn from the captain's vast experience. For { Harinath } [ Harinath ], 2012 was a breakthrough season and he will want to push on this year and provide the 'cement' to the { Surrey } [ Surrey County Cricket Club ] batting order.9's { Mark Church } [ Mark Church (cricketer) ]Captain: { Ed Joyce } [ Ed Joyce ]Overseas players: { Steve Magoffin } [ Steve Magoffin ] ( {Australia } [ Australia ] {), Scott Styris } [ Scott Styris ] ( {New Zealand } [ New Zealand ], for FL t20 only)How they did last season: Fourth in { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division One, semi-finalists in CB40 and FL t20.Season prospects: There is quiet optimism on the south coast that { Sussex } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] can continue their progress from last season and again mount a serious challenge on all three fronts. { Ed Joyce } [ Ed Joyce ], in his first full season in charge, will drop down the order to number four in the { Championship } [ County Championship ], allowing highly promising left-hander { Luke Wells } [ Luke Wells ] to open. With the under-rated { Chris Nash } [ Chris Nash (cricketer) ] as the other opener and { Mike Yardy } [ Mike Yardy ] at three, the { Sussex } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] top order has a solid look, and the return of { Rory Hamilton-Brown } [ Rory Hamilton-Brown ] from { Surrey } [ Surrey County Cricket Club ] adds an extra dimension to the middle order. The seam bowling department, which too often last season was reliant on { Steve Magoffin } [ Steve Magoffin ], has been strengthened by the signing of { Chris Jordan } [ Chris Jordan (cricketer) ], who found opportunities limited at { Surrey } [ Surrey County Cricket Club ], but how much success { Sussex } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] enjoy may depend on how much time spinner { Monty Panesar } [ Monty Panesar ] spends on { England } [ England ] duty.One to watch: { Chris Jordan } [ Chris Jordan (cricketer) ] has impressed during pre-season and, provided he can steer clear of the injuries which have so far disrupted his career, { Sussex } [ Sussex County Cricket Club ] have a genuinely quick { bowler } [ Bowling (cricket) ] and hard-hitting { batsman } [ Batting (cricket) ] capable of making a huge impact this summer.By BBC Sussex's Adrian HarmsCaptain: Jim TroughtonOverseas players: Jeetan Patel ( {New Zealand } [ New Zealand ])How they did last season: County champions, CB 40 finalists, fourth in Midlands/Wales/West Group in FL t20.Season prospects: { Warwickshire } [ Warwickshire County Cricket Club ] {'s } [ Warwickshire County Cricket Club ] strength in securing their seventh title last summer was the simple art of being able to bowl out the opposition twice. Five of their six wins - four of which came crucially in the first six games of the season - were achieved batting second and there is nothing to suggest they will be less of a force with the ball in 2013. The only concern is potential { England } [ England cricket team ] calls in a busy { Ashes } [ The Ashes ] summer, which also contains the { Champions Trophy } [ ICC Champions Trophy ] in June, but they managed pretty well in 2012 without { Jonathan Trott } [ Jonathan Trott ], { Ian Bell } [ Ian Bell ] and { Chris Woakes } [ Chris Woakes ]. Now, they have leading wicket taker { Chris Wright } [ Chris Wright (cricketer) ], top scorer { Varun Chopra } [ Varun Chopra ] and all-rounder { Rikki Clarke } [ Rikki Clarke ] in the { England } [ England ] frame as well, but the Bears still have strength in depth.One to watch: { Oliver Hannon-Dalby } [ Oliver Hannon-Dalby ] may have been surplus to requirements with his native { Yorkshire } [ Yorkshire ], but the { Bears } [ Sheffield Bears ] have spotted something in the tall seamer to suggest that he could be the latest to roll off the production line at highly-acclaimed bowling coach { Graeme Welch } [ Graeme Welch ]'s { Edgbaston } [ Edgbaston Cricket Ground ] finishing school. Judging by his nine-wicket match haul against the { Oxford } [ University of Oxford ] students, keep a look out too for another { fast } [ Pace bowling ] bowler, youngster { Tom Milnes } [ Tom Milnes ].By { BBC Midlands Sport } [ BBC Midlands ]'s { Ged Scott } [ Ged Scott ]Captain: { Daryl Mitchell } [ Daryl Mitchell ]Overseas players: { Thilan Samaraweera } [ Thilan Samaraweera ] ( {Sri Lanka } [ Sri Lanka ]), { Jacob Oram } [ Jacob Oram ] ( {New Zealand } [ New Zealand ], for { FL t20 } [ Twenty20 ])How they did last season: Bottom of { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division One (relegated), bottom of CB 40 group, { FL t20 } [ Twenty20 ] quarter-finalists.Season prospects: Despite managing to stay up in { 2011 } [ 2011 English cricket season ] for the first time since the introduction of two-division { County Championship } [ County Championship ] cricket, { Worcestershire } [ Worcestershire County Cricket Club ] were always punching above their weight. For a county with such meagre resources, relegation last summer looked inevitable from early season when they paid for the loss of { Gareth Andrew } [ Gareth Andrew ], who missed seven games, and main strike bowler { Alan Richardson } [ Alan Richardson (cricketer) ], who still chipped in with 57 wickets. By season's end, they had lost { Surrey } [ Surrey ]-bound { Vikram Solanki } [ Vikram Solanki ] too, but they hope overseas signings { Thilan Samaraweera } [ Thilan Samaraweera ], who is available for the whole summer, and { Twenty20 } [ Twenty20 ] specialist { Jacob Oram } [ Jacob Oram ] can trigger something in { Steve Rhodes } [ Steve Rhodes ]' young team.One to watch: { Ben Cox } [ Ben Cox (cricketer) ] was a 17-year-old schoolboy when he made a half-century and claimed { Marcus Trescothick } [ Marcus Trescothick ] as his first scalp on his { first-class } [ First-class cricket ] debut at { Taunton } [ County Cricket Ground, Taunton ] in September 2009. Having now learned his trade - and, with a former { England } [ England ] wicket-keeper like Rhodes as his coach, he will not have gone short on advice - the release of { Ben Scott } [ Ben Scott (cricketer) ] late last summer may have signalled the moment that Cox was deemed ready to be { Worcestershire } [ Worcestershire County Cricket Club ]'s first-choice keeper, assuming he sees off the challenge of { Australian } [ Australia ] { Michael Johnson } [ Michael Johnson (cricketer) ].By { BBC Midlands Sport } [ BBC Midlands ]'s { Ged Scott } [ Ged Scott ]Captain: { Andrew Gale } [ Andrew Gale ]Overseas players: None, although they are looking to re-sign { David Miller } [ David Miller (cricketer) ] (South Africa) for the limited-overs matchesHow they did last season: Second in { County Championship } [ County Championship ] Division Two (promoted), fifth in Group C in { CB40 } [ ECB 40 ], beaten finalists in FL t20.Season prospects: It is a big jump up from { Division Two } [ County Championship ] but { Yorkshire } [ Yorkshire County Cricket Club ] have recruited well, especially in the seam bowling department as { Liam Plunkett } [ Liam Plunkett ] and { Jack Brooks } [ Jack Brooks (cricketer) ] are both decent performers at this level. The club will be pleased to see batsmen { Joe Root } [ Joe Root ], { Jonny Bairstow } [ Jonny Bairstow ], and { Gary Ballance } [ Gary Ballance ] getting { England } [ England ] recognition, but it is bittersweet given that it means they night not be available for parts of the season. Their absence will give { Joe Sayers } [ Joe Sayers ] and { Alex Lees } [ Alex Lees (footballer) ] a chance to stake a claim in the team and it will be interesting to see how they do. It would be wonderful if { Yorkshire } [ Yorkshire ] could win the title in their 150th year, but that is the stuff of fairytales really and, in reality, I think they will come third or fourth.One to watch: { Adam Lyth } [ Adam Lyth ] started the { 2011 } [ 2011 in cricket ] season in fantastic form and was the first player in the country to reach 1,000 runs.

Here we tackle some of the questions being raised { online } [ World Wide Web ] and by { BBC } [ BBC ] audiences.Five days after the election, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] told { US } [ United States ] broadcaster { CBS } [ CBS ] that he would deport or jail between two and three million illegal migrants initially. Those targeted would be migrants with { criminal } [ Crime ] records, such as { gang } [ Gang ] members and { drug } [ Drug ] dealers.Overall, there are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the US, and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has published a 10-point plan on immigration which includes overturning amnesties introduced by President { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ], strictly enforcing immigration laws and deporting those who do not have correct documents.In the { US } [ United States ], though, illegal immigrants do have a right to { due process } [ Due process ], so many more { judges } [ Judge ] and prosecution { lawyers } [ Lawyer ] will need to be appointed to practically make this happen and this could clog up the court system for years to come. { Congress } [ United States Congress ] would need to approve funding for this process.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is expected to revoke { President } [ President of the United States ] { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] executive orders of 2014, which gave hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants temporary legal status and an indefinite reprieve from deportation. Executive orders allow { presidents } [ President of the United States ] to introduce their own legally binding policies without { Congressional } [ United States Congress ] approval.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has said that on his first day in office he will sign orders to speed up the removal of \"criminal illegal immigrants\", but that he will also end { President } [ President of the United States ] { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] non-enforcement policy and will detain people found illegally entering the US until they are deported. He has promised to increase the number of { enforcement } [ Enforcement ] officers needed to accomplish this.In its 2015 report, the { Migration Policy Institute } [ Migration Policy Institute ], a { Washington-based } [ Washington, D.C. ] non-partisan { think-tank } [ Think tank ], said there were about 820,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records.Meanwhile, a 2012 report by the non-partisan { Congress Research Service } [ Congress Research Service ] think-tank said that only a small minority of all the unauthorised immigrants had committed violent crimes.It did not provide an overall number of { illegal immigrants } [ Illegal immigration ] in the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ]Even by the standards of billionaire businessmen, { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is an unusually litigious man who has been involved in thousands of lawsuits - both those he has launched and those he has defended - over the years.The { president-elect } [ President-elect of the United States ] is currently facing 75 active { lawsuits } [ Lawsuit ], according to an analysis by { USA Today } [ USA Today ] newspaper.By far the most pressing - and potentially embarrassing for the newly elected leader - are several lawsuits launched over the now-defunct { Trump University } [ Trump University ], which centre on former students claiming they were charged tens of thousands of dollars for courses that promised to unlock the secrets of { real estate } [ Real estate ] { entrepreneurship } [ Entrepreneurship ] - and didn't. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] denies the claims.Because these were launched long before he assumed office, no { presidential immunity } [ Presidential immunity ] statutes apply and Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] will have to attend court when required.Article II of the { US Constitution } [ Constitution of the United States ] states that the president \"shall be removed from Office on { Impeachment } [ Impeachment ] for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\"If Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] loses the case against him on { Trump University } [ Trump University ] that may leave him open to { impeachment } [ Impeachment ], some legal scholars suggest.Christopher L Peterson, professor of Law at the { University of Utah } [ University of Utah ], argues that \" {fraud } [ Fraud ] and { racketeering } [ Racket (crime) ] are serious crimes that legally rise to the level of impeachable acts\".Beginning the process of { impeachment } [ Impeachment ] requires a { majority } [ Majority ] vote in the { House of Representatives } [ United States House of Representatives ] {. } [ Majority ]  Whether the { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ], who hold the majority of seats, would want to { impeach } [ Impeachment in the United States ] their own { president } [ President of the United States ] is another matter.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has not proposed reductions on { Social Security } [ Social Security (United States) ] {. } [ Social Security (United States) ]The funding needed for { Social Security } [ Social Security (United States) ] is expected to balloon over the next decade, and it's unclear where the money to pay for it will come from without tax increases.The { Republican Party } [ Republican Party (United States) ] {'s } [ Republican Party (United States) ] official 2016 platform says: \"Current retirees and those close to { retirement } [ Retirement ] can be assured of their benefits. Of the many reforms being proposed, all options should be considered to preserve { Social Security } [ Social Security (United States) ].\"However, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has appointed { Michael Korbey } [ Michael Korbey ] to his transitional team to head { Social Security } [ Social Security (United States) ] {. } [ Social Security (United States) ]The { Associated Press } [ Associated Press ] reports that \"as a senior adviser to the { Social Security Administration } [ Social Security Administration ], Korbey was an advocate for the { George W Bush } [ George W. Bush ] administration's failed attempt to privatise { Social Security } [ Social Security (United States) ] {\". } [ Social Security Administration ]Indiana Governor { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ] has described himself as \"a { Christian } [ Christian theology ], a { conservative } [ Conservatism ] and a { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ], in that order\".The 57-year-old has been a loyal supporter of { Mr Trump } [ Donald Trump ], but - at times - he has not been afraid to speak his own mind.Prior to being named the business mogul's { running mate } [ Running mate ] in July, Mr Pence had criticised Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] proposed ban on { Muslims } [ Islam ] entering the US as \"offensive and unconstitutional\".And during his vice-presidential debate performance on 4 October {, } [ Vice President of the United States ] Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] defended his own positions - not necessarily those of Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] - when challenged {. } [ Vice President of the United States ]Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] has served as { governor } [ Governor of Indiana ] of { Indiana } [ Indiana ] since 2013, but he also has 12 years of legislative experience as a member of the { US House of Representatives } [ United States House of Representatives ].He is a favourite among { social } [ Social conservatism ] { conservatives } [ Conservatism ] who boasts considerable experience in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {. } [ Washington, D.C. ]Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] had considered running for { president } [ President of the United States ] in { 2016 } [ 2016 United States presidential election ] {. } [ Vice President of the United States ]Read our full profile here.He says the issue should be decided at { state } [ States and territories of Australia ] level, rather than nationally, and that he was unhappy with the 2015 { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ] ruling earlier this year that made { same-sex marriage } [ Same-sex marriage ] legal across the country.But earlier this year he told { Fox News } [ Fox News ] he would \"strongly consider\" appointing { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ] justices who would reverse it.He has not made the issue a priority. His { Vice President-elect } [ Vice President of the United States ], { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ], is strongly opposed to { gay } [ Gay ] marriage.Election officials do not finalise the data until about two weeks after polling day. But the { US Elections Project } [ US Elections Project ] estimates that 128.8m { Americans } [ Americans ] voted, out of 231.5m eligible voters - a { turnout } [ Voter turnout ] rate of 55. In 2012, turnout was 58.6%, and in { 2008 } [ 2008 Summer Olympics ] it was 62.Hillary { Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ] looks set to win the popular vote by a narrow margin.The latest count shows that { Mrs Clinton } [ Bill Clinton ] won 60,981,118 votes, which amounted to 47.8% of the total, compared with { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] 60,350,241 votes, or 47. { As } [ As (song) ] a result of victories in key \"swing\" states (those more likely to change hands between the two main parties) carrying large numbers of { Electoral College } [ United States Electoral College ] votes {, } [ Electoral college ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] won 290 { Electoral College } [ United States Electoral College ] votes - comfortably ahead of Mrs { Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ] {'s } [ Hillary Clinton ] 228. Two states, { Michigan } [ Michigan ] and { New Hampshire } [ New Hampshire ], have not yet been declared.Other candidates polled 6,260,817 votes.To answer one of the most-asked questions on { Google Trends } [ Google Trends ] - { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is 70 and { Hillary Clinton } [ Hillary Clinton ] is 69.He will be inaugurated at noon on Friday, 20 January 2017. In the meantime he will name his team, develop policy positions, and have access to government briefings, including { classified information } [ Classified information ] on { national security } [ National security ] and { military operations } [ Military operation ].In an interview with { The Hill } [ The Hill (newspaper) ] website last year, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] appeared to scotch rumours that he would break with long tradition and not live in the presidential residence and principal workplace in { Washington DC } [ Washington, D.C. ] {. } [ Washington, D.C. ]\"Yes, I would live in the { White House } [ White House ] because it's the appropriate thing to do,\" he said. He went further, adding that he would \"rarely leave the { White House } [ White House ] because there's so much work to be done\".Since Mr Trump won Tuesday's election, the { Federal Aviation Administration } [ Federal Aviation Administration ] has implemented flight restrictions over the area of his home on { New York } [ New York City ]'s { Manhattan } [ Manhattan ] island that expire on 21 January, the day after his planned inauguration and expected move to the { White House } [ White House ].Apparently not. In an interview with { CNN } [ CNN ], { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s lawyer said the privately owned { Trump Organization } [ The Trump Organization ] - a company with US and international holdings including hotels, golf courses and commercial and residential property - would be held in a \"blind trust\" run by Mr Trump's adult children, { Donald Junior } [ Donald Trump Jr. ], { Ivanka } [ Ivanka Trump ] and { Eric } [ Eric Trump ].Whether such an arrangement constitutes a true { blind trust } [ Blind trust ] that avoids { conflicts of interest } [ Conflict of interest ] is being questioned by critics, as Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] will still be aware of his business holdings and how policies might affect them, and direct relatives will be running them on a day-to-day basis.Trump to trust in daughter power {Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has made building a { wall } [ Trump wall ] along the border to stop { illegal immigration } [ Illegal immigration ] a refrain of his { campaign } [ Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign ].In an interview on { CBS } [ CBS ] Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has said \"a { wall } [ Wall ] is more appropriate\" in some parts but \"there could be some fencing\".A document on his { website } [ Website ] outlines how he would \"make { Mexico } [ Mexico ] pay\". It would begin on \"day one\" with amending money transfer rules so that no \"alien\" would be able to wire money out of the { US } [ United States ] without showing documents establishing their lawful presence in the country. { Mexico } [ Mexico ] has rejected his assertion that { it } [ Information technology ] will pay.Given the expected cost and scale of the { wall } [ Wall ], the challenges of acquiring privately owned land along the border route to build it on, and { Congressional } [ United States Congress ] backing from sceptical { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ], many analysts think it will never be built. Instead, they expect an increase in border policing and tightening of immigration rules. {Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has pledged to repeal the { Affordable Healthcare Act } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act ] {, } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act ] which he intends to scrap \"very, very quickly {\". } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act ]However, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has now said he is open to leaving intact key parts of { President } [ President of the United States ] { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] healthcare bill.He has said he will keep the ban on { insurers } [ Insurance ] denying coverage for { pre-existing conditions } [ Pre-existing condition ] {. } [ Pre-existing condition ]He told the { Wall Street Journal } [ The Wall Street Journal ] that he also favoured allowing young adults to be insured on their parents' policies.BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher notes that: \"the challenge for the president-elect is that the { Obamacare } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ] features he praises - such as its mandate that insurers cover pre-existing medical conditions - are made possible by portions of the law he has condemned, like requiring all { Americans } [ United States ] to obtain insurance.Keeping the { law } [ Law ]'s carrots while abandoning its sticks could prove difficult.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] often broke with { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] orthodoxy while campaigning and didn't pay a political price. He may learn that as { president } [ President of the United States ] he won't get far without his { party } [ Political party ] establishment's help.\"A { US } [ United States ] { president } [ President of the United States ] has the authority to launch a { nuclear } [ Nuclear weapon ] attack within minutes. The { nuclear } [ Nuclear weapon ] briefcase (or \"football\", as it's known) kept close to him at all times contains the codes he must use to authenticate his identity when ordering military commanders to carry out a { nuclear } [ Nuclear weapon ] strike. The { Defence Secretary } [ Secretary of State for Defence ] is also required to authenticate the codes, but does not have the authority to veto the decision. A complex { system } [ System ] of { people } [ People ], procedures and { technology } [ Technology ] then kicks into action to launch a { nuclear } [ Nuclear weapon ] attack. The briefcase also contains a \"menu\" of pre-planned strike options, targeting different parts of the world in different ways.Donald { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] critics have questioned whether he has the temperament, and intellectual capacity, to weigh complex information under the pressure of a nuclear alert - and have also raised concerns about someone known for his temper having access to the nuclear codes.His statements have given mixed messages on his approach, and he has stressed that \"unpredictability\" is important where { military } [ Military ] - including { nuclear } [ Nuclear weapon ] - options are involved.In April he told { NBC } [ NBC ] he would \"be the last to use { nuclear weapons } [ Nuclear weapon ]\" describing their use as \"a horror\".\"I will not be a happy trigger like some people might be, but I will never, ever rule it out,\" he said.But a month earlier he said: \"Somebody hits us within { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ], you wouldn't fight back with a nuke?\"In March, { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] said that { abortions } [ Abortion ] should be illegal and he supported \"some form of punishment\" for women who had them. However, he later backed down from this, saying the legality of abortions should be left up to individual states, with any criminal penalties being reserved for abortion providers.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has said that he supports an abortion ban exception in cases of \" {rape } [ Rape ], { incest } [ Incest ] and danger to the life of the mother\". He has also said he opposes the use of { Medicaid } [ Medicaid ] to cover abortions for low-income women, and that with a { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ]-controlled { Congress } [ United States Congress ] he is willing to make that a matter of law.Most abortions in the US are carried out by { clinics } [ Abortion clinic ], with { Planned Parenthood } [ Planned Parenthood ] being one of the largest providers of the service. Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has promised to stop funding the organisation, which provides { reproductive healthcare } [ Reproductive health ] - including { birth control } [ Birth control ] measures - to women across the { United States } [ United States ].But { Planned Parenthood } [ Planned Parenthood ] {, } [ Planned Parenthood ] whose affiliates operate around 650 health centres nationwide, has vowed to continue its work, tweeting: \" {Planned Parenthood } [ Planned Parenthood ] { has been here } [ Planned Parenthood ] for 100 years. One thing is clear we'll never back down & we'll never stop providing care for our patients.\"Women with health insurance can currently obtain contraceptives for free under the { Affordable Healthcare Act } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act ] - known as { Obamacare } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act ] - which { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has vowed to dismantle.According to { Vox } [ Vox (website) ], he could exclude { birth control } [ Birth control ] from the programme simply by changing a definition, rather than as part of wider moves to overturn the act.But Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has not said he plans to do this - or said whether he would include { contraceptives } [ Birth control ] in a scheme to replace { Obamacare } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ]. He has said he backs access to { contraceptives } [ Birth control ] without a { prescription } [ Medical prescription ] {. } [ Prescription drug ]There's also concern about { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] plan to cut { Planned Parenthood } [ Planned Parenthood ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] funding. He has said the money will be reallocated to other providers, but critics say these would not be able to fill the gap in provision.Fears that { birth control } [ Birth control ] will become harder and more expensive to access have prompted a flurry of interest in long-term { contraceptive } [ Birth control ] implants known as { IUDs } [ Intrauterine device ] {. } [ Intrauterine device ] Women are advised to consult a { doctor } [ Physician ] on { contraceptive } [ Birth control ] options.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has stated that he wants jobs to go to { American } [ United States ] workers first and that he wants to reduce the numbers of foreign workers admitted to the { US } [ United States ].Under his administration he says { immigrants } [ Immigration ] will be selected among other things on their ability to be financially self-sufficient and he has said people will be subject to \"extreme vetting\" and an \"ideological test\".There has been no detail given on what this vetting and testing would involve and experts point out that the US immigration code already includes ideological tests and screens those attempting to enter the country.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] also wants to temporarily suspend { immigration } [ Immigration ] from regions that 'export terrorism and where safe { vetting } [ Vetting ] cannot presently be ensured'.Over the years { Congress } [ United States Congress ] has granted wide powers to the { president } [ President of the United States ] to change { immigration } [ Immigration ] rules and he could institute even greater background screening checks. However, there is debate about whether he could impose lower limits on the number of people who can immigrate or change current { green card } [ Green card ] categories, without { Congressional } [ United States Congress ] support.According to { US } [ United States ] law the { president } [ President of the United States ] does hold the authority to \"suspend the entry of all { aliens } [ Alien (law) ] or any class of { aliens } [ Alien (law) ]\" if the group's entry \"would be detrimental to the interests of the { United States } [ United States ].\"  That can extend for as long as the { president } [ President of the United States ] deems necessary.After last year's { mass shooting } [ San Bernardino shooting ] in { San Bernardino } [ San Bernardino, California ], { California } [ California ], when 14 people were killed, Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] issued a press release calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on { Muslims } [ Islam ] entering the US \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\".The statement attracted condemnation from around the globe and significantly from his { Vice President-elect } [ Vice President of the United States ] { Mike Pence } [ Mike Pence ] {, } [ Mike Pence ] who called the proposal \"offensive and { unconstitutional } [ Constitutionality ] {\". } [ Mike Pence ]Over the months it appears Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] may have abandoned his plan. In October, Mr { Pence } [ Mike Pence ] told journalists he no longer protested against the proposed ban \"because it's not { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] position now {\". } [ Donald Trump ]After the { election } [ 2016 United States presidential election ], the page on his { website } [ Website ] that set out the policy appeared to have been removed, replaced by a redirect to the site's main page. That raised questions about whether it was being dropped, but the page was later restored and the { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] campaign told the { Washington Post } [ The Washington Post ] it had been an error.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has expressed scepticism about the science behind { climate change } [ Climate change ] and wants to get the US out of the { Paris Climate Agreement } [ Paris Agreement ] deal.  He says the deal is \"bad for { US } [ United States ] business\" and will allow \"foreign bureaucrats control over how much { energy } [ Energy ] we use\".In 2012, he tweeted that the concept of { global warming } [ Global warming ] was created by the { Chinese } [ China ] to make { US } [ United States ] manufacturing non-competitive. But last January {, } [ List of One Piece characters ] he described that comment as a joke.However, the { Paris Agreement } [ Paris Agreement ] has been ratified and is already part of { international law } [ International law ] {. } [ Paris Agreement ] While Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] probably would easily find sufficient political backing to withdraw { US } [ United States ] support, the formal process to do this would take four years.Since the election, delegates from 200 countries at the UN climate talks in { Morocco } [ Morocco ] have said they are prepared to move ahead with work on the { Paris Agreement } [ Paris Agreement ] without the { US } [ United States ].The { president-elect } [ President-elect of the United States ] {'s } [ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ] foreign policy, expressed in his \" {America First } [ America First (policy) ] {\" } [ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ] plan, states that it will always prioritise US interests, and that foreign allies should bear more of the cost of military action and defence.Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has made it clear he intends to reassess { US } [ United States ] involvement in the { Western } [ Western world ] military alliance { Nato } [ NATO ].In an interview in July with the { New York Times } [ The New York Times ], he stated that in the face of a future attack from { Russia } [ Russia ], { Nato } [ NATO ] members could only expect the { US } [ United States ] to defend them if they \"have fulfilled their obligations to us\" - an apparent breach of the alliance's mutual-defence treaty.Following his election, { European } [ Europe ] leaders have asked Mr Trump to clarify his position, while { Nato } [ NATO ] Secretary General { Jens Stoltenberg } [ Jens Stoltenberg ] reminded him that the treaty commitment was \"something absolutely unconditioned\".Whether a { compromise } [ Compromise ] can be reached is, at present, not known.Former { US } [ United States ] Assistant Secretary of State PJ Crowley told the { BBC } [ BBC ]: \"At some point, probably quite early on, { Kim Jong-un } [ Kim Jong-un ] will stand up (spreads arms wide) and say to President { Trump } [ Donald Trump ]: 'We're a nuclear power. What are you doing to do about it?' That will be a key test for { President } [ President of the United States ] { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {. } [ Donald Trump ]\"Much of { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] {'s } [ Donald Trump ] foreign policy remain unclear.In May, he did suggest that he would sit down with { North Korean } [ North Korea ] leader { Kim Jong-un } [ Kim Jong-un ] to try to stop { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] {'s nuclear programme } [ North Korea and weapons of mass destruction ], proposing a major shift in { US } [ United States ] policy toward the isolated nation by saying: \"I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him.\" {Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] endorsed him and called him a \"wise politician\" and a \"far-sighted candidate\", and cheered his comments that { South Korea } [ South Korea ] should pay more for { US } [ United States ] troops to remain on its soil.But following the { election } [ Election ], { North Korea } [ North Korea ] has made it clear it does not intend to give up its { nuclear weapons } [ Nuclear weapon ] {. } [ Nuclear weapon ]Addressing this question in the last few days, { Graham Allison } [ Graham Allison ], one of the world's leading experts on nuclear proliferation and containment, said: \"One of the many problems with { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] is that he has apparently not worked his way through any of the possible scenarios regarding a { North Korean } [ North Korea ] threat. Our { commander-in-chief } [ Commander-in-chief ] is the only person who stands between us and the possibility of getting blown to hell. Whether he would be impetuous, or impatient, or not know the material, we just don't know.\"Mr { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has also said he would be open to allowing { Japan } [ Japan ] and { South Korea } [ South Korea ] to build their own nuclear arsenals for their protection against { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and { China } [ China ].How might { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] deal with { Kim Jong-un } [ Kim Jong-un ]?The { US } [ United States ] spends billions on { Africa } [ Africa ] through aid and investment, but { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ] has said very little about how he intends to deal with the continent.On { foreign aid } [ Aid ] in general {, } [ Saint-Germain-en-Laye ] he has said he would rather see money spent in the { US } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] This raises concerns over the future of { US } [ United States ] aid schemes such as the Power Africa project, which aims to double the number of people with electricity across the continent and the Pepfar plan to tackle HIV/Aids.His tough talk on so-called { Islamic State } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ], support for torture and { anti-Muslim } [ Islamophobia ] immigration statements all suggest a probable hard-line approach to security in { North Africa } [ North Africa ], where { US } [ United States ] military involvement has increased in recent years.Is { Africa } [ Africa ] on { Donald Trump } [ Donald Trump ]'s radar?When the news of a possible { Trump } [ Donald Trump ] victory started to emerge, { Canada } [ Canada ]'s immigration website crashed, a phenomenon that was attributed to higher than normal level of traffic. There was also a surge of traffic to the { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ] immigration website and the { Google } [ Google ] search \" {Australia } [ Australia ] immigration\" hit a massive spike.It is uncertain at this stage if this wave of interest by { US } [ United States ] citizens will result in people actually deciding to make the move to { Canada } [ Canada ] or elsewhere.However, while getting a travel { visa } [ Travel visa ] to { Canada } [ Canada ] would be straightforward for many { Americans } [ United States ], moving permanently is a different issue.Canada has several different { immigration } [ Immigration ] programmes and each has different application and eligibility requirements.

At the { time } [ Time (magazine) ] I did not think so.\" {McAfee } [ John McAfee ] acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla.\"He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody.\"There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the { time } [ Time (magazine) ] I certainly did not believe that.\"In fact, as { ABC News } [ American Broadcasting Company ] later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about { McAfee } [ Robert McAfee ] the previous month.It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had \"terrified\" other residents by walking around with { shotguns } [ Shotgun ] and shining lights in their eyes, and that { taxis } [ Taxicab ] and other traffic had been arriving at his property \"at all hours\", causing a disturbance.\"I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the { States } [ United States ] {,\" } [ United States ] says { McAfee } [ Steve McAfee ] when pressed about this.\" {Belize } [ Belize ] is not like { America } [ United States ] where you file a complaint and then the { police } [ Police ] come out and chase things out. You file a { complaint } [ Complaint ] and it goes into a { drawer } [ Drawer (furniture) ] {. } [ Drawer (furniture) ]\" {McAfee } [ John McAfee ] then went on the run, saying he feared he would be \"silenced\" if he was caught and thrown in jail.It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a { blog } [ Blog ] and giving frequent { interviews } [ Interview ] - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught.\"I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,\" he recalls.\"All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair.\"You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the { police } [ Police ] and { army } [ Army ] had it for that month and a half I was { underground } [ Underground culture ]. I just made sure I looked different than that.\"Questioned about the affair, { Dean Barrow } [ Dean Barrow ], { Belize } [ Belize ]'s prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a \"person of interest\".\"I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,\" the politician added.The { BBC } [ BBC ] put Mr McAfee's claims of corruption to the { Belize } [ Belize ] government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a { South Korean } [ South Korea ] man who had never visited the country.It sent this reply: {Belize } [ Belize ] has made great strides in improving { transparency } [ Transparency (behavior) ] and { ethical } [ Ethics ] behaviour across all { government } [ Government ] departments.Where any sniff of { corruption } [ Corruption ] and evidence of such has been proven, the { prime minister } [ Prime minister ] and the { government } [ Government ] have moved swiftly to stamp it out.This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the    junior minister of immigration.The { US } [ United States ] government and the { Commonwealth } [ Commonwealth of Nations ] have been instrumental in supporting { Belize } [ Belize ] in   addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption.Corruption is a cancer that { Belize } [ Belize ] will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it.The past is the past and this { Belize } [ Belize ] government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs.During this time { McAfee } [ Robert McAfee ] continued to see { Emshwiller } [ Emshwiller ] {. } [ Emshwiller ]\"When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls.\"How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me.\"She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from { Vice } [ Vice (magazine) ] magazine revealed they were documenting { McAfee } [ Sean McAfee ] {'s } [ Sean McAfee ] life on the run.In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to { Guatemala } [ Guatemala ] - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the { Vice } [ Vice (magazine) ] website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data.\"I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,\" remembers McAfee.\"We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in { Guatemala } [ Guatemala ] illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment.\"A few days later { McAfee } [ John McAfee ] was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to { Belize } [ Belize ], but a week later he was allowed to fly to { Miami } [ Miami ] a free man.\"After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'\" he says.\"But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred.\" {McAfee } [ McAfee ] has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.The family has called the reward a \"hollow gesture\" and suggested if { McAfee } [ Robert McAfee ] really wanted to help he would have met with the { Belize } [ Belize ] police.A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman.\"Mr { McAfee } [ Robert McAfee ] {'s } [ Robert McAfee ] claims and { his } [ Robert McAfee ] behaviour have been extreme,\" he told the { BBC } [ BBC ].\"The investigation is ongoing and { McAfee } [ Robert McAfee ] remains a { person of interest } [ Person of interest ] {. } [ Person of interest ] If { McAfee } [ McAfee ] were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of { Belize } [ Belize ].\"So long as the { crime } [ Crime ] remains unsolved, it is inevitable the { entrepreneur } [ Entrepreneurship ] will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that.\"There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,\" he says.\"Someone who thinks you're a { hero } [ Hero ] and some that think you're a { villain } [ Villain ]. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent.\"That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in { Belize } [ Belize ].In addition to the { graphic novel } [ Graphic novel ], he is working with a { Canadian } [ Canada ] firm to make both a { documentary } [ Documentary film ] and a { movie } [ Film ] about his time there.He adds that { George Jung } [ George Jung ] - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by { Johnny Depp } [ Johnny Depp ] in the film { Blow } [ Blow (film) ] - has been picked to write his biography.While those projects brew, { McAfee } [ Steve McAfee ] has returned to { Silicon Valley } [ Silicon Valley ], announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net.\"If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,\" he explains.He says the { D-Central } [ D-Central ] units will fit in people's pockets and allow their { phones } [ Mobile phone ], { tablets } [ Tablet computer ] and { PCs } [ Personal computer ] to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a { node } [ Node (networking) ] - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their { encrypted } [ Encryption ] data relayed { relayed } [ Relay ] via other { D-Central } [ D-Central ] boxes.Each will frequently change their { network } [ Computer network ] identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.He suggests it will appeal to { college } [ College ] students who want to copy { music } [ Music ] anonymously and to { businesses } [ Business ] wanting to prevent the theft of { corporate } [ Corporation ] secrets.He's also well aware that in the light of { Edward Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] {'s } [ Edward Snowden ] leaks about surveillance techniques used by the { US } [ United States ] and { UK } [ United Kingdom ] governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts.\"You know from their own { paranoia } [ Paranoia ] and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,\" he says.Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?At this point, like so much of { John McAfee } [ John McAfee ]'s life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word."}, {"\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20170524235653/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36962933": "After a summer of change in the { top flight } [ Premier League ] - with a whole host of new { managers } [ Manager (association football) ] and top-quality { players } [ Football player ] - it is a task that remains as painful as ever.But with the new { season } [ 2012\u201313 in English football ] starting on Saturday, here is how I think the { season } [ 2012\u201313 in English football ] will look at the very end - with the caveat that what happens in the remainder of the { transfer window } [ Transfer window ] could yet have a significant impact.The arrival of the world's most celebrated coach, { Pep Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ], is the fulfilment of a long-held dream for { Manchester City } [ Manchester City F.C. ]'s owners - he is the man they have always wanted at the head of their { football } [ Association football ] organisation. The { Etihad } [ Etihad (brand) ] house has been built waiting for him to move in.City's run to the { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] semi-final and a { Capital One Cup } [ FA Cup ] final win barely covered up a campaign of { Premier League } [ Premier League ] under-achievement with { Manuel Pellegrini } [ Manuel Pellegrini ] in charge last season. They were left hanging on until the last game of the campaign to secure a { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] place.Guardiola is the perfect choice to get more out of a quality squad that has too often seemed short of inspiration and motivation. He is a fiercely driven perfectionist who will not let standards slip.Midfielder { Ilkay Gundogan } [ Ilkay Gundogan ] will add guile when he is fit while winger { Nolito } [ Nolito ] is a shrewd capture from { Celta Vigo } [ RC Celta de Vigo ].Now that City have signed defender { John Stones } [ John Stones ] from { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ], responsibility will lie with him for curing the defensive ills caused by the poor form of { Eliaquim Mangala } [ Eliaquim Mangala ] and { Nicolas Otamendi } [ Nicolas Otamendi ], as well as captain { Vincent Kompany } [ Vincent Kompany ]'s injuries.I'm backing a { Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ]-inspired { City } [ Manchester City F.C. ] to reclaim the { Premier League } [ Premier League ] title.Players out: { Martin Demichelis } [ Martin Demichelis ] (released), { Seko Fofana } [ Seko Fofana ] ( {Udinese } [ Udinese Calcio ]), { Aaron Mooy } [ Aaron Mooy ] ( {Huddersfield Town } [ Huddersfield Town A.F.C. ] on loan), { Marlos Moreno } [ Marlos Moreno ] ( {Deportivo La Coruna } [ Deportivo de La Coruna ] on loan).Manchester United are a club with something to prove - and they have appointed a brilliant, albeit highly-divisive manager who also has something to prove in { Jose Mourinho } [ Jose Mourinho ] after his sacking at { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] just seven months after his team won the title.Dutchman { Louis van Gaal } [ Louis van Gaal ] may have won the { FA Cup } [ FA Cup ] but his was a joyless reign and this superpower needed an X Factor on and off the pitch to renew their damaged status. Will it be more style than substance?The shining symbol of { United } [ Manchester United F.C. ]'s new future is the return of { Paul Pogba } [ Paul Pogba ] from { Juventus } [ Juventus F.C. ] for a world-record \u00a389m - although this was the same player allowed to escape for about \u00a31.5m four years ago.The creative spark provided by former { Borussia Dortmund } [ Borussia Dortmund ] midfielder { Henrikh Mkhitaryan } [ Henrikh Mkhitaryan ] and { Pogba } [ Pogba ] will arguably be of greater long-term significance than Ibrahimovic's short-term sparkle.There are, though, still questions to be answered.Where will { Wayne Rooney } [ Wayne Rooney ] fit into { Mourinho } [ Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ]'s grand plan? And what about { United } [ United Kingdom ]'s defence?
