His diminutive stature and characteristically { bouffant } [ Bouffant ] hair have been parodied by some in the { West } [ Western world ] {. } [ Western world ]\"He's a mysterious person -- I think by design,\" said Han S. Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the { University of Georgia } [ University of Georgia ] and a frequent visitor to { North Korea } [ North Korea ]. \" {Mystery } [ Mystery (emotion) ] is a source of { leverage } [ Leverage (finance) ] and { power } [ Power (social and political) ]. It's maintaining { uncertainty } [ Uncertainty ] {. } [ Uncertainty ]\"But for the citizens of his { Democratic People's Republic of Korea } [ Democratic People's Republic of Korea ] {, } [ Joseon ] { Kim } [ Kim Il-sung ] was well regarded.This Just In: Up-to-the-minute news on the death of Kim Jong IlHis father, { Kim Il Sung } [ Kim Il-sung ], founded { North Korea } [ North Korea ] with { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] backing after { World War II } [ World War II ].Kim Jong Il was just a little boy when the Communist { North } [ North Korea ] invaded the American-backed { South } [ South Korea ], sparking the { Korean War } [ Korean War ] in 1950. The peak, on the northern border with { Chinese } [ China ] { Manchuria } [ Manchuria ], is the highest on the peninsula and the site where { Korean } [ Korea ] legend says the nation came into existence 5,000 years ago.Cause of death reported to be \"overwork\"Researchers who are more objective place Kim's birth in the { Far Eastern } [ Far East ] region of the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ] on February 16, 1942. His father had fled to the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ] when the { Japanese } [ Japan ] put a price on his head for guerrilla activities in occupied { Korea } [ Korea ].The family returned to the northern part of the peninsula after the { Japanese } [ Japan ] surrender in { World War II } [ World War II ], and { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] dictator { Josef Stalin } [ Joseph Stalin ] anointed { Kim Il Sung } [ Kim Il-sung ] as the leader of the { Democratic People's Republic of Korea } [ Democratic People's Republic of Korea ].Timeline: { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] {Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ]'s younger brother drowned as a child and his mother died when he was 7 years old. Shortly after, when the { Korean War } [ Korean War ] broke out , he was sent to { Manchuria } [ Manchuria ] {, } [ Manchuria ] returning three years later when it ended.Despite these hardships, { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] was presumably surrounded by { luxury } [ Luxury goods ] and { privilege } [ Privilege (law) ] for most of his upbringing. As the first-born son of an iron-fisted dictator, \"the doors were likely opening for him from a very young age,\" according to Dae-sook Suh, a professor of political science at the { University of Hawaii } [ University of Hawaii ] who specializes in the { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] government.TIME: The iconography of { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ]Gradually { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] was groomed for the top position, making public appearances in front of cheering crowds.In 1980, { Kim Il Sung } [ Kim Il-sung ] formally designated his { son } [ Kim Il-sung ] as his { successor } [ Succession to Kim Il-sung ] {. } [ Kim Il-sung ]Kim Jong Il was given senior posts in the { Politburo } [ Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea ], the { Military Commission } [ Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea ] and the { Party Secretariat } [ Secretariat of the Workers' Party of Korea ].He took on the title \"Dear Leader\" and the government began spiing a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father, the \"Great Leader.\"In 1991, { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] became { commander-in-chief } [ Commander-in-chief ] of { North Korea } [ North Korea ] {'s } [ North Korea ] powerful armed forces, the final step in the long grooming process.Three years later, when { Kim Il Sung } [ Kim Il-sung ] died suddenly from a { heart attack } [ Myocardial infarction ] at 82, most outsiders predicted the imminent collapse of { North Korea } [ North Korea ] {. } [ North Korea ] The { nation } [ Nation ] had lost its venerated { founding father } [ Founding father ] {. } [ Father ]Just a few years earlier, its powerful alliances had evaporated with the fall of the { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] bloc and { China } [ China ] {'s } [ China ] move toward a { market-based } [ Market economy ] system. The { economy } [ Economy ] was on the rocks and { energy } [ Energy ] and { food } [ Food ] were in short supply. A series of weather disasters, combined with an inefficient state-run agricultural system, further eroded the food supply, leading to mass starvation.The timing could not have been worse for replacing the only leader { North Korea } [ North Korea ] had known.After his { father } [ Kim Jong-il ] {'s } [ Kim Jong-il ] elaborate public funeral, { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] dropped out of sight, fueling rumors {, } [ Kim Jong-il ] but he soon managed to consolidate power {. } [ Kim Jong-il ]Zakaria: Will the { North Koreans } [ North Korea ] rise up?Under his newly organized government, his father's presidential post was left vacant and Kim took the titles of general secretary of the { Workers Party } [ Workers' Party of Korea ] and chairman of the National Defense Commission -- a group of 10 men that includes the heads of the air force, army and navy, who are now considered the most powerful in the country.\"It's a peculiar government to say the least,\" Dae-sook Suh said. \"He honors the legacy of { his father } [ Kim Il-sung ], but the new government is a { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] government. It's quite different from his { father } [ Father ] {'s } [ Father ] {. } [ Father ]\" {Kim Il Sung } [ Kim Il-sung ]'s unique style of { Stalinism } [ Stalinism ] was subordinated to the more militant theme of { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ]'s \"Red Baer\" policy, introduced in 1996.The changes afoot were dramatically illustrated in 1997 by the defection of { Hwang Jang Yop } [ Hwang Jang-yop ] -- the architect of the { juche } [ Juche ] philosophy and the first high-level official to seek asylum in { South Korea } [ South Korea ].In a { news conference } [ News conference ] after his defection {, } [ Seoul ] Hwang warned of a growing possibility that his homeland might launch an attack {. } [ Seoul ] { \"The preparation } [ Preparation (principle) ] for { war } [ War ] exceeds your { imagination } [ Imagination ] {,\" he } [ George Harrison ] said.Many outsiders viewed the flight of { Hwang } [ Hwang Chong-hee ] as another sign that the { North Korean } [ North Korea ] regime was on its last legs, but once again it weathered the storm, perhaps even benefiting from the fears of war heightened by { Hwang } [ Hwang Chong-hee ] {'s } [ Hwang Chong-hee ] warning.Despite sending a test missile over { Japan } [ Japan ] in June 1999 and other such incidents, { North Korea } [ North Korea ] under { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] also sent signals that it is open to new alliances after decades of isolation.Many analysts conclude that { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] has played a poor hand of cards skillfully.\"I tend to disregard rumors that he's irrational, a man that nobody can do business with,\" said Alexander Mansourov, a longtime { Korea } [ Korea ] scholar and a former { Russian } [ Russia ] diplomat who was posted in { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] in the late 1980s. \"I believe that he is { smart } [ Smartness ] {. } [ Smartness ] He's pragmatic. And I think he can be ruthless. He's a man who will not loosen his grip in any way on the people around him.\"His obsession for movies led to one of the strangest incidents associated with him: The 1978 kidnappings of { South Korean } [ South Korea ] actress { Choi En-hui } [ Choi En-hui ] and her director husband { Shin Sang-ok } [ Shin Sang-ok ]. The couple's account of their ordeal, given after they escaped { North Korea } [ North Korea ] in 1986, sounds like a { B-movie } [ B movie ] script.They said { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] held { Choi } [ Choi Gwang-hee ] under { house arrest } [ House arrest ] and imprisoned { Shin } [ Shin So-jo ] for four years for a failed escape attempt. Kim then forced them to work in the { North Korean } [ North Korea ] film industry, paying them handsomely while keeping them in the gilded cage of his artistic and social circles. Although the country was having problems paying its debts, Kim lived extravagantly and spent tens of millions of dollars on their film productions, according to { Choi } [ Choi Eun-hee ] and { Shin } [ Shin Soo-hwa ].The couple told { Washington Post } [ The Washington Post ] reporter { Don Oberdorfer } [ Don Oberdorfer ] that { Kim } [ Kim Jong-il ] was a \"micro-manager\" who made all the major decisions in { North Korea } [ North Korea ] because of his father's ailing condition. Shin described Kim as \"very bright,\" but said that he had no sense of guilt about his misdeeds \"due to his background and upbringing.\"While the Dear Leader is said to have indulged his appetite for the finer things, his people were literally starving to death. The collapse of the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ] in the early 1990s hit { North Korea } [ North Korea ] hard when guaranteed trade deals with { Moscow } [ Russia ] came to an end.And then devastating { floods } [ Flood ] compounded the { famine } [ Famine ] {. } [ Famine ] The { North Korean } [ North Korea ] regime admitted almost 250,000 people perished between 1995 and 1998, but some outside groups believe it was more like ten times that figure.Nevertheless, an artifice of a successful state was maintained in the capital, { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ], including an opulent { subway } [ Pyongyang Metro ] -- proof that { Kim } [ Kim Jong-il ] would say reflected { North Korea } [ North Korea ]'s progress under his and his father's leadership.In 2000, there appeared to be a thaw in North-South relations leading to the first-ever summit meeting between { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] and his then counterpart from the { South } [ South Korea ] President { Kim Dae Jung } [ Kim Dae-jung ]. { South Korea } [ South Korea ]'s so-called \"sunshine policy\" of engagement seemed to be bearing fruit.But { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] pressed ahead with his { nuclear weapons } [ Nuclear weapon ] program and then- {U. } [ United States ]S. President { George W. } [ George W. Bush ] Bush labeled { North Korea } [ North Korea ] as part of the \"axis of evil\" in his 2002 { State of the Union } [ State of the Union ] address. A year later, { North Korea } [ North Korea ] withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.In 2006, the North conducted a { nuclear test } [ 2006 North Korean nuclear test ] and test fired missiles adding extra urgency to the { six-party talks } [ Six-party talks ] designed to deal with { North Korea } [ North Korea ] {'s nuclear program } [ North Korea and weapons of mass destruction ].A breakthrough came in 2007, when { Kim Jong } [ Kim Jong-il ] il finally agreed to disable the nuclear reactor at { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon Nuclear Plant ] in return for fuel and better relations with the { U. } [ United States ]S.But despite dramatically blowing up { Yongbyon } [ Yongbyon County ]'s { cooling tower } [ Cooling tower ], { North Korea } [ North Korea ] seemed to backtrack afterwards and the deal appeared to be jeopardy. In August 2008, { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] halted the disabling of the { plutonium } [ Plutonium ]-producing plants in after a stalemate over verification measures.Months later -- as { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] wrapped up his final term in office -- the { U. } [ United States ]S. government agreed to take { North Korea } [ North Korea ] off its list of countries that sponsor terrorism. The move was a turnaround from the { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] administration's previous refusal to drop { North Korea } [ North Korea ] from the list until { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] agreed to set up an internationally recognizable mechanism to verify it was revealing all its nuclear secrets.Analysts say it is easy for outsiders to demonize { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ], a dictator who spent an estimated 25% or more of his country's gross national product on the military while many in his country went hungry.But in { North Korea } [ North Korea ], closed off from outside influences, fearful of threats from its neighbors, and subjected to decades of political socialization on top of a long tradition of a strict hierarchical system, { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] is viewed positively by most people, said Han Park of the { Center for Study of Global Issues } [ Center for Study of Global Issues ].\"The level of reverence for { Kim Jong Il } [ Kim Jong-il ] in { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is quite underestimated by the outside,\" { Park } [ Park Soo-ah ] said. \"He is regarded by many as not only a superior leader but a decent person, a man of high morality. Whether that's accurate is not important if you want to deal with { North Korea } [ North Korea ].

The list represents a group of 17 { countries } [ Country ] that harbor the majority of the { Earth } [ Earth ]'s { species } [ Species ] and are therefore considered extremely { biodiverse } [ Biodiversity ].From its coral reefs in the { Caribbean Sea } [ Caribbean Sea ] to its tropical jungles in { Chiapas } [ Chiapas ] and the { Yucatan } [ Yucat\u00e1n ] peninsula and its deserts and prairies in the north, { Mexico } [ Mexico ] boasts an incredibly rich variety of flora and fauna.Some 574 out of 717 { reptile } [ Reptile ] { species } [ Species ] found in { Mexico } [ Mexico ] -- the most in any country -- can only be encountered within its borders. It is home to 502 types of { mammals } [ Mammal ], 290 species of { birds } [ Bird ], 1,150 varieties of { birds } [ Bird ] and 26,000 classifications of { plants } [ Plant ].Pronatura, a { non-profit organization } [ Nonprofit organization ] that works to promote { conservation } [ Conservation movement ] and { sustainable development } [ Sustainable development ] in { Mexico } [ Mexico ], has selected six species which it says symbolize the problems faced by the destruction of nature. \"However, there is a countless number of { species } [ Species ] in { Mexico } [ Mexico ] which find themselves in danger of { extinction } [ Extinction ].One of the largest { raptors } [ Bird of prey ] or { birds of prey } [ Bird of prey ] in the world, the { Golden Eagle } [ Golden eagle ]'s { wingspan } [ Wingspan ] can reach lengths greater than two metres. Only the { Bald Eagle } [ Bald Eagle (bird) ] and the { California Greater } [ California Greater ] exceed it in size in { North America } [ North America ].With its powerful hooked bill and long and sharp claws it can sometimes capture prey of a size that is surprising for its size, including { crane } [ Crane (bird) ], wild { ungulates } [ Ungulate ] and domestic livestock, though more often than not it tends to feed off small mammals such as { rabbits } [ Rabbit ], { hares } [ Hare ], ground squirrels and { prairie dogs } [ Prairie dog ] as well as reptiles and small-to-medium sized birds.Primarily a solitary { bird } [ Bird ], the Golden { Eagle } [ Eagle ] pairs up to breed, building { nests } [ Bird nest ] made of dry branches in cliffs and { escarpments } [ Escarpment ]. The { female } [ Female ] typically lays two { eggs } [ Egg ] which are incubated by both the { male } [ Male ] and { female } [ Female ]. Usually, only one of the hatchlings survives.The { Golden Eagle } [ Golden eagle ] can be found in { Asia } [ Asia ] and { Europe } [ Europe ] and mainly in the western part of { North America } [ North America ]. It was common in { Mexico } [ Mexico ] but in recent years has become a rare sight. Human activity, in the form of { hunting } [ Hunting ], capturing and commercial sale have also contributed to its decline.Pronatura has lobbied for legal protection of this bird that forms part of { Mexico } [ Mexico ] {'s flag } [ Flag of Mexico ] and has launched conservation projects in its natural habitat, such as in the { Cumbres de Monterrey National Park } [ Cumbres de Monterrey National Park ] and the Cuatro Cixc3xa9negas Biosphere Reserve.Gray WhalePachico Mayoral, a { Mexican } [ Mexico ] fisherman form { Baja California } [ Baja California ], claims to be the first person to have a friendly encounter with a { gray whale } [ Gray whale ].Up until then this enormous { cetacean } [ Cetacea ] -- an adult can reach a length of 16 meters and weigh in at 36 tons - had been known as the devil fish for its aggressive behavior when hunted.The main group of { gray } [ Gray whale ] whales is found in the northeastern { Pacific } [ Pacific Ocean ] {. } [ Pacific Ocean ] Each year a herd of 25,000 whales sets out on what is believed to be the longest migration in the animal kingdom - 12,500 miles - between their feeding grounds in the { Bering } [ Bering Sea ] and { Chukchi } [ Chukchi Sea ] seas off { Alaska } [ Alaska ] and their breeding territory in the warmer waters of the lagoons of { Baja California } [ Baja California ]. Over its lifetime, it is estimated that an { Eastern Pacific } [ Pacific Ocean ] { gray whale } [ Gray whale ] will travel the equivalent of a return trip to the { moon } [ Moon ].A smaller herd of about 300 gray whales can be found in the Western Pacific between { Korea } [ Korea ] and the { Kamchatka } [ Kamchatka Peninsula ] peninsula in { Russia } [ Russia ].Excessive hunting in the 19th century pushed the { gray whale } [ Gray whale ] to the brink of extinction but protection mandated by the { International Whaling Commission } [ International Whaling Commission ] in 1946 and the declaration by the { Mexican } [ Mexico ] government of Laguna San Ignacio in 1972 as a { Gray Whale } [ Gray whale ] refuge means that it is one of the few success stories.Pronatura and the { Aztec } [ Aztecs ] foundation have raised nearly $4 million with which they hope to guarantee the protection of 20,000 hectares of the gray whale's habitat in { Baja California } [ Baja California ] and ensure its survival in the years to come.JaguarIt may be top of the food chain but this doesn't guarantee the survival of the { jaguar } [ Jaguar ] in { Mexico } [ Mexico ] {. } [ Mexico ] The largest cat in the { Western Hemisphere } [ Western Hemisphere ] (it's nearest rival is the { puma } [ Cougar ]), the { jaguar } [ Jaguar ] can be found anywhere from the southern { United States } [ United States ] to as far south as northern { Argentina } [ Argentina ]. In { Mexico } [ Mexico ], it can be found mainly in the tropical forests of { Chiapas } [ Chiapas ] and the { Yucatan } [ Yucat\u00e1n ] peninsula.With its tawny yellow coat speckled with black rosette-like spots for camouflage, the { jaguar } [ Jaguar ] resembles most the { leopard } [ Leopard ] of { Africa } [ Africa ], although it has a stockier build which makes it adept at climbing trees, stalking through undergrowth and swimming. Its unique anatomy -- it has an unusually large head and powerful teeth in comparison to other big cats -- gives it an abnormally powerful bite, meaning that it can take on armoured reptiles such as { caiman } [ Caiman ], { crocodiles } [ Crocodile ] and { tortoises } [ Tortoise ], while it often bites through an animal's skull to inflict a killer blow to the brain.It plays an essential part in maintaining a balanced { ecosystem } [ Ecosystem ] by hunting { species } [ Species ] which would put local { environments } [ Biophysical environment ] out of kilter if they were to become too abundant.The { jaguar } [ Jaguar ] is an important { symbol } [ Symbol ] in local { Mexican } [ Mexico ] { culture } [ Culture ]. The { Mayans } [ Maya civilization ] believed it was a messenger between the living and the dead and { Mayan } [ Maya civilization ] kings often incorporated the { jaguar } [ Jaguar ] into their name, while an elite group of { Aztec } [ Aztecs ] warriors were known as \"Jaguar Knights'. Its decline is mainly due to the destruction of its natural { habitat } [ Habitat ]. For example, in the Ria Lagartos Biosphere reserve in northern { Yucatyan } [ Yucat\u00e1n ] state, Pronatura reports that only 20 percent of the original forest cover remains, the rest having been cleared for cattle-herding.Tourist development also plays its part; El Ocotal Natural Reserve, where cameras placed in the forest have captured images of six individual jaguars and pumas, is close to { Mexico } [ Mexico ]'s tourism capital, { Cancun } [ Canc\u00fan ].Pronatura estimates that if present conditions persist, the { jaguar } [ Jaguar ] could become { extinct } [ Extinction ] in the northeastern part of the { Yucatan } [ Yucat\u00e1n ] within 30 to 40 years.Mexican Prairie DogClosely related to { squirrels } [ Squirrel ], { chipmunks } [ Chipmunk ] and { marmots } [ Marmot ], the Mexican prairie dog is a burrowing mammal found in northeastern { Mexico } [ Mexico ].It earnt its name from its distinctive call -- a mixture of barks and yips -- which is believed to be one of the most sophisticated languages in the animal world.The { Mexican prairie dog } [ Mexican prairie dog ] feeds on the herbs and grasses of the plains of northeastern { Mexico } [ Mexico ] and lives in \"towns\" -- excavated colonies of up to 50 individuals which are ruled by a single { alpha } [ Alpha (ethology) ] male.Listed as an { endangered species } [ Endangered species ] since 1970, the { prairie dog } [ Prairie dog ] now occupies less than two percent of its former territory and can now only be found in southern { Coahuila } [ Coahuila ] and northern { San Luis Potosi } [ San Luis Potos\u00ed ] -- an area of less than 500 square miles.While vulnerable to hunting from { coyotes } [ Coyote ], { bobcats } [ Bobcat ], { badgers } [ Badger ] and { hawks } [ Hawk ], its largest threat is loss of habitat due to agricultural expansion. Mexican farmers have often viewed the { prairie dog } [ Prairie dog ] as a pest and it has often been hunted or poisoned.Pronatura Mexico fights for the legal protection of \"Los Llanos de Tokio\", an area of grassland in { Nuevo Leon } [ Nuevo Le\u00f3n ], { San Luis Potosi } [ San Luis Potos\u00ed ] and { Coahuila } [ Coahuila ] and it has signed a conservation agreement with private land owners and ejidos (farming collectives) to protect 42, 000 hectares of land.Monarch ButterflyEach year, between December and March, these orange and black-patterned { butterflies } [ Butterfly ], the size of an adult human hand, congregate in numbers of up to 250 million in a pine and oyamel tree forest in { Michoacan } [ Michoac\u00e1n ] in Central { Mexico } [ Mexico ].They migrate approximately 3,000 miles from the border between northeastern { United States } [ United States ] and { Canada } [ Canada ] and their gathering to breed in { Mexico } [ Mexico ] is considered one of the most extraordinary sights in the natural world.During its { life cycle } [ Biological life cycle ], which can be up to 20 weeks, the Monarch { Butterfly } [ Butterfly ] goes through what is known as a complete { metamorphosis } [ Metamorphosis ], comprising four stages. From { eggs } [ Egg ] laid by the { female } [ Female ], a { caterpillar } [ Caterpillar ] is hatched. The { caterpillar } [ Caterpillar ] eats its own egg case and feeds off { milkweed } [ Asclepias ] while storing energy in the form of { fat } [ Fat ] and { nutrients } [ Nutrient ].It then spins a { silk } [ Silk ] pad and hangs from a { leaf } [ Leaf ] or { twig } [ Twig ] while it { molts } [ Moulting ]. Within its green { exoskeleton } [ Exoskeleton ], { hormonal } [ Hormone ] changes occur, converting the { caterpillar } [ Caterpillar ] into a { butterfly } [ Butterfly ]. After two weeks a mature { butterfly } [ Butterfly ] emerges.But in the last 20 years { forest cover } [ Forest cover ] in its breeding { habitat } [ Habitat ] has decreased by an estimated 40 percent. { Illegal logging } [ Illegal logging ], an increase in cases of { forest fires } [ Wildfire ] and high levels of { poverty } [ Poverty ] in the region which put pressure on { natural resources } [ Natural resource ], have all contributed to a situation in which Pronatura believes the forest may disappear completely within 20 years.Pronatura and the { non-profit organization } [ Nonprofit organization ] The National Foundation for the Conservation of the Monarch Butterfly's Habitat have launched projects to promote sustainable development programs that help improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of the \"El Chapulxc3xadn\" community and reduce the direct pressure on the natural resources. They also hope to reforest 30, 000 hectares of the Monarch Butterfly reserve with oyamel trees.VaquitaThe elusive vaquita (\"little cow\") or cochito (\"little pig\") is one of the smallest and most { endangered } [ Endangered species ] { cetaceans } [ Cetacea ] in the world.The only { endemic } [ Endemism ] marine mammal in { Mexico } [ Mexico ], this porpoise can only be found in a small area in the upper { Gulf of California } [ Gulf of California ] and the { Colorado River } [ Colorado River ] delta.The { vaquita } [ Vaquita ] can grow up to 1.5 meters and closely resembles the harbor porpoise in life span and breeding habits.Only 50 years ago the { vaquita } [ Vaquita ] was unkown to science and yet it is now classed as \"in critical danger of extinction\" by the { World Conservation Union } [ International Union for Conservation of Nature ] {. } [ World Conservation Union ]The { vaquita } [ Vaquita ] is difficult to monitor because it often dives when it hears motor boats approaching but generous estimates place its population at 600. However, a recent study put the number as low as 150. With an estimated 39 to 54 dying every year as a result of by-catches, it seems only a matter of time before the vaquita disappears completely.Its main threat comes from { gillnets } [ Gillnetting ] -- highly effective fishing nets used to capture the { totoaba } [ Totoaba ], an enormous fish with high commercial value -- in which the { vaquita } [ Vaquita ] gets caught up and drowns.In 1983 the { Mexican } [ Mexico ] government established the Upper Gulf of California Biosphere Reserve to protect them but it would seem that more stringent fishing laws must be implemented if the { vaquita } [ Vaquita ] is to survive. { E-mail } [ Email ] to a friend'."}, {"cnn/training/7fe069963811a2a2e72944b9491878210e428bd5": "Drones are everywhere.Consider that just in the past few days, a { Federal Aviation Administration } [ Federal Aviation Administration ] official revealed that in March a { US Airways } [ US Airways ] passenger jet nearly collided with a small-unmaed aircraft that looked similar to an { F-4 Phantom } [ McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II ] jet and was flying above 2,000 feet over { Florida } [ Florida ]. These details and the fact that the { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] was described as \"camouflaged\" suggest that it was not a civilian { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] {. } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ]Then Sunday the { Iranians } [ Iran ] aounced that they had engineered a copy of a highly sophisticated { U. } [ United States ]S. surveillance drone that they had captured in 2011. Iran's state television showed footage of what they claimed was a replica of the { American } [ United States ] { RQ-170 Sentinel } [ Lockheed RQ-170 Sentinel ] drone. A photograph showed { Iran } [ Iran ]'s { Supreme Leader } [ Supreme leader ], Ayatollah { Ali Khamenei } [ Ali Khamenei ], sitting next to the { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ].The same day that the { Iranians } [ Iran ] showed off their new { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] {, Sen. } [ Sen. ( Unmanned aerial vehicle) ] { Rand Paul } [ Rand Paul ], { R } [ Republican Party (United States) ]- {Kentucky } [ Kentucky ], wrote an op-ed in { The New York Times } [ The New York Times ] arguing against the appointment of { David Barron } [ David Barron (judge) ] as a federal judge. Barron was a { White House } [ White House ] lawyer who was involved in drafting the legal opinions used to justify the 2011 drone strike in { Yemen } [ Yemen ] that killed { Anwar al-Awlaki } [ Anwar al-Awlaki ], an { American } [ United States ] citizen who had taken a leadership role in { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ].Paul wrote, \"Killing an { American } [ United States ] citizen without a trial is an extraordinary concept and deserves serious debate. I can't imagine appointing someone to the { federal } [ Federal government of the United States ] bench, one level below the { Supreme Court } [ Supreme Court of the United States ], without fully understanding that person's views concerning the { extrajudicial killing } [ Extrajudicial killing ] of { American } [ United States ] citizens. I believe that all { senators } [ Senate ] should have access to all of these opinions. Furthermore, the { American } [ United States ] people deserve to see redacted versions of these memos so that they can understand the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration's legal justification for this extraordinary exercise of executive power.\"Not so long ago, killing an { American } [ United States ] citizen on the other side of the world with an armed { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] would have been in the realm of { science fiction } [ Science fiction ]. Before { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ], the { United States } [ United States ] had only a handful of experimental { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] that had never been used to kill anyone. Today, there are at least 7,000 { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] in the { U. } [ United States ]S.Nine facts about armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ]This large { American } [ United States ] fleet of { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] is a harbinger of an important trend. Armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as { tanks } [ Tank ] were during { World War II } [ World War II ] {. } [ World War II ] We can expect to see them used not only by the { United States } [ United States ], but also by other countries such as { China } [ China ] and { Russia } [ Russia ] that are jumping into the production of armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ].But armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] raise a number of { moral } [ Morality ] and { political } [ Politics ] issues that are unresolved. In { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] drone campaign is deeply unpopular because { Pakistanis } [ Pakistan ] ask themselves: What gives the { United States } [ United States ] the right to invade the sovereign airspace of our nation and sometimes kill our civilians, even in the service of the laudable goal of killing al Qaeda militants?For { American } [ United States ] readers, do a thought experiment in which armed { Mexican } [ Mexico ] drones were routinely killing members of drug cartels living in { Texas } [ Texas ], but they were also sometimes killing a number of ordinary { Texans } [ Texas ] and you get a sense of how the average { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] thinks about this issue.In { Yemen } [ Yemen ], the { U. } [ United States ]S. drone campaign has also become increasingly controversial because drones continue to kill { Yemeni } [ Yemen ] civilians -- as they did last month in a strike that targeted members of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {'s } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] { Yemeni } [ Yemen ] affiliate. In that strike on April 19, at least nine { militants } [ Militant ] were killed but so were three { civilians } [ Civilian ] {. } [ Civilian ]Even with these issues {, } [ United States Department of Defense ] { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] present features that make them appealing to { political } [ Politics ] and { military } [ Military ] leaders. Drones are not simply pieces of { artillery } [ Artillery ] that happen to fly. They have four characteristics that mean they are likely to reshape { warfare } [ War ] at a { tactical } [ Military tactics ] level.First, armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] are different from any previous form of { artillery } [ Artillery ] because they can linger over and assess a target for many hours. That capability can quite dramatically lower the { civilian } [ Civilian ] casualty rates that have been typical of earlier eras of { warfare } [ War ].The smallest { bomb } [ Bomb ] dropped by the { U. } [ United States ]S. Air Force is typically 500 pounds. Such a { bomb } [ Bomb ] caot, of course, distinguish between a { civilian } [ Civilian ] and a { combatant } [ Combatant ]. A { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] can do so. And it can also shoot much smaller { missiles } [ Missile ], such as the 100-pound { Hellfire } [ AGM-114 Hellfire ] missile.In that sense there is a case to be made that armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] presage a more { ethical } [ Ethics ] form of warfare that kills fewer { civilians } [ Civilian ]. But that doesn't mean of course that { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] and the people who operate them won't kill { civilians } [ Civilian ] in the future. The { U. } [ United States ]S. drone campaigns in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ] have killed hundreds of civilians over the past half decade.Second, armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] also make it possible to wage { war } [ War ] against particular individuals. In a sense { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] are flying { assassins } [ Assassination ] that target particular people.It is not an accident that the rise of { drone warfare } [ Unmanned combat aerial vehicle ] has coincided with { America } [ United States ] {'s } [ United States ] unconventional war against { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and its allies. In conventional { wars } [ War ], { armies } [ Army ] wearing { uniforms } [ Uniform ] attack each other. But in the kind of { drone warfare } [ Drone strike ] that the { United States } [ United States ] has conducted since { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] outside of conventional war zones in countries such as { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ], drone strikes are not directed at someone because of his status as a uniformed member of another military force, but rather because of the individual's suspected coection to { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] or an allied group.Bergen: Target an { American } [ United States ] with { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ]?Third, there is a lower threshold for the use of force when armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] are an option. In many ways the use of armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] is akin to the use of { cyberwarfare } [ Cyberwarfare ] {. } [ Cyberwarfare ] Both tactics greatly reduce or eliminate the number of deaths that would result from a conventional armed conflict.  And whoever launches a { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] attack or a { cyberattack } [ Cyberattack ] pays no costs of the kind that would typically take place on a conventional { battlefield } [ Battlefield ].You can't shoot down a { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] pilot or kill a { computer } [ Computer ] technician launching some kind of { cyberattack } [ Cyberattack ] thousands of miles from the intended target. For this reason, { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] and cyber capabilities can make conflict more likely as the barriers to engage in either { drone warfare } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] or cyberconflict are so low. (Until, of course, the opponent has the resources to retaliate in kind.)Fourth, { drone warfare } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] is taking place in an unprecedented information environment in which the { U. } [ United States ]S. government collects ever-vaster amounts of data. This { data } [ Data ] collection is so extensive that the { National Security Agency } [ National Security Agency ] {, } [ National Security Agency ] for instance, can record every phone call that is made in a particular { country } [ Country ].It is this merger of \"big data\" and drone technology, which is also complemented by human intelligence about suspected terrorists provided by { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] assets on the ground in places such as { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] {'s } [ Pakistan ] tribal regions, that has made drone warfare against { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and its allies so effective.The { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] drone campaign in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] has killed 58 militant leaders, according to a count by the { New America Foundation } [ New America (organization) ] {. } [ New America (organization) ] Thirty-five militant leaders have also been killed in { Yemen } [ Yemen ] {. } [ Yemen ] Meanwhile, at least 339 civilians have been killed as well as at least 2,200 foot soldiers in militant groups in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ]. At least 230 other people were reported killed, though it was not clear from reliable news accounts if they were { militants } [ Militant ] or { civilians } [ Civilian ].Indeed, using the most conservative estimates from a database of drone attacks maintained by the { New America Foundation } [ New America (organization) ], the { Obama administration } [ Presidency of Barack Obama ] authorized the killing of more than 2,400 people in drone strikes in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ] from the time it first assumed office until the end of March 2014. (Using the least conservative estimates from that { database } [ Database ], the total number of people killed was almost 4,000.)Put another way, using the most conservative estimates of the numbers of people killed in drone strikes by the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration, they amount to three times the total number of the some 800 prisoners at the { Guantanamo } [ Guantanamo Bay detention camp ] prison camp placed there by the { Bush } [ George H. W. Bush ] administration. As { President } [ President of the United States ] { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] reportedly told some of his aides, \"Turns out I'm really good at killing people. Didn't know that was going to be a strong suit of mine.\" {Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] recognized the devastation that such { drone strikes } [ Drone strike ] were inflicting on his organization, writing a lengthy memo about the issue that was later recovered in the compound in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] where he was killed three years ago.In the October 2010 memo to a lieutenant, { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] advised his men to leave the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] tribal regions where the { drone strikes } [ Drone strike ] have been overwhelmingly concentrated. Bin Laden wrote, \"I am leaning toward getting most of our brothers out of the area\" and urged his followers to depart for the remote { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] province of { Kunar } [ Kunar Province ], explaining that \"due to its rough terrain and many mountains, rivers, trees, it can accommodate hundreds of the brothers without them being spotted by the enemy.\"The { civilian } [ Civilian ] casualty rate from { drone } [ Unmanned combat aerial vehicle ] strikes has been dropping dramatically in recent years. According to { New America Foundation } [ New America (organization) ] data, the casualty rate in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] for civilians and also for \"unknowns\" -- those who were not identified in news reports definitively as either militants or civilians -- was around 40% under President { George W. } [ George W. Bush ] Bush when the { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] program was in its infancy. It has come down to about 7% under { Obama } [ Barack Obama ].Bergen: Obama's high-stakes drone war in { Yemen } [ Yemen ]In 2013 in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ], the numbers of civilians killed by drones in both countries combined was the lowest ever, in the single digits, according to the { New America Foundation } [ New America (organization) ]'s data.This shift has been accomplished because of the combined effects of smaller munitions, improved drone flight technology, better intelligence on the ground, stricter { White House } [ White House ] guidelines regarding the use of drones, increased { congressional oversight } [ United States congressional oversight ] of the drone program and greater public scrutiny of the issue.It will be many years before other countries are able to build up the capacity that the { United States } [ United States ] has to carry out lethal { drone } [ Unmanned combat aerial vehicle ] strikes. As of 2013, the { United States } [ United States ] had drone bases in countries such as { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], { Djibouti } [ Djibouti ] and { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ]. And it isn't as easy as some might think for other nations to arm unarmed drones.Such weapons systems require specific { electrical engineering } [ Electrical engineering ]; the wings must be reinforced for the aircraft to sustain the force of launching a missile; the { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] must be equipped with { fire control systems } [ Fire-control system ], and built-in mounting brackets are needed to attach { munitions } [ Ammunition ] to the vehicle.But even with these inherent limitations, the { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] industry thrives, and more companies and nations continue to jump on board the { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] bandwagon. And the { U. } [ United States ]S. aggressive and secretive { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] campaign against { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and its affiliates is setting a powerful international precedent about the use of armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ].It is these kinds of { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] strikes that are controversial since the use of armed { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] in a conventional war is not much different, legally, than a maed aircraft that drops bombs or fires { missiles } [ Missile ].There has been virtually no substantive public discussion about what an international legal framework governing such { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] attacks should be among policymakers at the international level. It's long past due for that conversation to happen.'."}, {"cnn/training/b304840e0b177da18db3d23e53e231a76e08d012": "(CNN) -- { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is \"skating very close to a dangerous line\" after weeks of saber-rattling, { U. } [ United States ]S.

That would mean it could reach as far as { Guam } [ Guam ], a { Western Pacific } [ Pacific Ocean ] territory that is home to { U. } [ United States ]S. { naval } [ United States Navy ] and { air } [ United States Air Force ] bases and where the { United States } [ United States ] recently said it was placing { missile defense } [ Missile defense ] systems.After a { launch } [ Rocket launch ], { U. } [ United States ]S. satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as { Japan } [ Japan ].The { United States } [ United States ] and { Japan } [ Japan ] would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down, { U. } [ United States ]S. officials say.Russian Foreign Minister { Sergey Lavrov } [ Sergey Lavrov ] on Wednesday told { CNN } [ CNN ] that despite being an ally of { North Korea } [ North Korea ], it stands with the { United States } [ United States ].\"On { North Korea } [ North Korea ] {, } [ North Korea ] we have no differences with the { United States } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] { One } [ One (rapper) ] just shouldn't scare anyone with { military } [ Military ] maneuvers and there's a chance things might calm down,\" { he } [ He (rapper) ] said.U.S., { North Korean } [ North Korea ] officials met secretly in MarchA launch without warning? {South Korean } [ South Korea ] Foreign Minister { Yun Byung-se } [ Yun Byung-se ] said at a parliamentary hearing Wednesday that \"according to intelligence obtained by our side and the { U. } [ United States ]S., the possibility of a missile launch by { North Korea } [ North Korea ] is very high,\" the semiofficial { South Korean } [ South Korea ] news agency { Yonhap } [ Yonhap ] reported.Yun said he was basing his assessment on { South Korean } [ South Korea ] and { U. } [ United States ]S. intelligence.On Tuesday, a { U. } [ United States ]S. official said that the { American } [ United States ] government believes a test launch could happen at any time and without { North Korea } [ North Korea ] issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping that would warn planes and vessels to stay away from the missile's path.The official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information, cautioned that most of the information comes from { satellite imagery } [ Satellite imagery ], so it's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the { United States } [ United States ] caot gather information on the ground.He said the launch could be \"imminent\" but also cautioned that the { United States } [ United States ] \"simply doesn't know.\" Based on what the { United States } [ United States ] has seen, the belief is that the { missiles } [ Missile ] have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch.Speaking at a { Senate } [ United States Senate Committee on Armed Services ] { Armed Services } [ United States Senate Committee on Armed Services ] hearing Tuesday, { Locklear } [lear (TV series) ] said the { U. } [ United States ]S. military would not want to shoot down a { North Korean } [ North Korea ] missile whose trajectory would send it into the open sea. But he said if a { missile } [ Missile ] {'s } [ Japanese missile ] path appeared to threaten a { U. } [ United States ]S. ally, such as { Japan } [ Japan ], interceptor missiles could be used to try to bring it down.Japan poised to react 'calmly'Japan's deployment of missile defenses in { Tokyo } [ Tokyo ] follows similar measures taken ahead of the { North } [ North Korea ] {'s } [ North Korea ] rocket launches last year. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Tuesday that his government would do \"calmly\" whatever needed to be done to protect its population.In a sign of the level of concern, however, the port city of { Yokohama } [ Yokohama ] had to apologize for prematurely publishing a warning of a missile launch on the { Twitter } [ Twitter ] page of its emergency management agency. The { tweet } [ Twitter ] was up for about 20 minutes before being removed.The agency said that the misleading { tweet } [ Twitter ] was caused by { human error } [ Human error ] and that it would work on changing its system to prevent the problem from happening again.Since the { U. } [ United States ]N. { Security Council } [ United Nations Security Council ] voted last month to impose new sanctions on Kim's regime over the { latest North Korean nuclear test } [ 2017 North Korean nuclear test ], { Pyongyang } [ Pyongyang ] has kept up a steady flow of words and acts that could give the impression of a nation heading inexorably toward conflict.On Tuesday, it advised foreigners in { South Korea } [ South Korea ] to secure shelter or evacuate the country in case of hostilities on the { Korean Peninsula } [ Korean Peninsula ], the latest in a string of ominous warnings.It also kept more than 50,000 of its workers from an industrial complex jointly operated with { South Korea } [ South Korea ], which had been a key symbol of cooperation between the two countries.North Korea's war of words escalates: A timeline of the crisis'Holiday atmosphere' inside North KoreaBut on the same day, state media published articles that described festive events and international visits, suggesting a much less fraught situation inside North Korea.The state-run { Korean Central News Agency } [ Korean Central News Agency ] (KCNA) reported that various sporting events were happening or scheduled to take place to mark the 101st aiversary next week of the birth of { Kim Il Sung } [ Kim Il-sung ], the founder of { North Korea } [ North Korea ] and the grandfather of { Kim Jong Un } [ Kim Jong-un ].\"The ongoing { sports } [ Sport ] tournaments make the { country } [ Country ] seethe with { holiday } [ Holiday ] atmosphere,\" { KCNA } [ KCNA ] said.

The { SEALs } [ United States Navy SEALs ] had taken up position on the fantail of the { Bainbridge } [ Bainbridge Island, Washington ] and were carefully monitoring { Phillips } [ Phillips (TV series) ] while he was in the custody of the pirates.One of the pirates had just pointed his { AK-47 } [ AK-47 ] at the { American } [ United States ] captain as if he were going to shoot him.

Details of what exactly happened during the { Somali } [ Somalia ] operation are still murky.The two raids over the weekend show that President { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the { United States } [ United States ] is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] drones for the same purpose in countries such as { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Yemen } [ Yemen ].For the { White House } [ White House ], part of the appeal of special operations and drones is that they do not, of course, consume anything like the blood and treasure that are expended on conventional military operations such as the wars in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] {. } [ War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) ]Indeed, the { SEALS } [ Royal Canadian Air Force ] have had considerable experience working in and around { Somalia } [ Somalia ] in recent years. Six months after the rescue of Phillips, { Obama } [ Barack Obama ]'s national security team authorized a mission to take out Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a leader of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] in { Africa } [ Africa ].Nabhan was killed by { SEAL Team 6 } [ SEAL Team 6 ] in a helicopter raid on September 14, 2009, as he was driving south of the { Somali } [ Somalia ] capital, { Mogadishu } [ Mogadishu ].

But they also expect that at some point, { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s media arm, { As-Sahab } [ As-Sahab ], will release a video to mark { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s death for maximum propaganda impact, one that could feature a \"martyrdom\" video recorded by { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] to encourage followers.The { As-Sahab } [ As-Sahab ] videotape would probably include a message from { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {'s } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] new leader.It might take several weeks for { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] to put together such a video; recent audio messages recorded by { al-Zawahiri } [ Al-Zawahiri ] on the democracy movement sweeping the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] have been several weeks out of date. But according to { IntelCenter } [ IntelCenter ], which monitors { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] propaganda, it would be feasible for { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] to compile and distribute such a video within a week.The clear guidelines for succession will, however, be little consolation to { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s rank and file members. { Bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] was the charismatic icon of the { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] organization and may have continued to play a greater operational role than thought.The seizure by { American } [ United States ] { Navy SEALs } [ United States Navy SEALs ] of multiple thumb drives, storage devices and hard drives full of data raise questions about whether { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] was continuing to receive information about { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] operations and whether he was in turn passing on instructions through couriers. The discovery of information in { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {'s } [ Osama bin Laden ] files on what appears to be a small-scale aspirational plot to derail { U. } [ United States ]S. commuter trains on the 10th aiversary of { September 11 } [ September 11 attacks ] indicates that { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] was being briefed even on the minutiae of some of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {'s } [ Al-Qaeda ] operations.Western intelligence officials had believed that bin Laden signed off on only { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s most significant plots after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ], including the 2006 plot to bomb seven trans-Atlantic airliners leaving { London } [ London ]'s { Heathrow Airport } [ London Heathrow Airport ] and the \"Mumbai-style\" plot to attack { European } [ Europe ] cities last fall.While { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s charisma inspired a generation of recruits, { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdelkader al-Zawahiri ] is a self-styled intellectual whose long-winded video and audiotapes must be tedious to even the most committed of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] members and whose arrogance has alienated many in { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] ranks over the years.Bin Laden was the key unifying force within { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ], but { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdelkader al-Zawahiri ] has always been a deeply polarizing figure within the organization, obsessing over minor theological differences with others and prioritizing { jihad } [ Jihad ] in { Egypt } [ Egypt ] over other causes. But unlike { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ], the { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] did not make up for this by earning { jihadist } [ Jihad ] fame on the front lines of the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] jihad against the { Soviets } [ Soviet Union ].During the 1990s, many within { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] resented { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdelkader al-Zawahiri ] for persuading { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] to chael significant funds into his { Egyptian Islamic Jihad } [ Egyptian Islamic Jihad ] organization that otherwise would have been given to them. That was a symptom of the rivalry and tension that existed since { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s founding between the group's { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] faction and other nationalities within the organization, especially those from { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Yemen } [ Yemen ] and the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] states.Mixed emotions about { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {'s } [ Osama bin Laden ] death: How should we feel?Those who follow { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] say it was only { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {'s } [ Osama bin Laden ] charismatic aloofness, epitomized by his habit of listening to his top lieutenants bicker over strategy before deciding a course of action, that kept { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {'s } [ Osama bin Laden ] strong centrifugal forces in check over the years.The challenge that { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdelkader al-Zawahiri ] now faces in keeping { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] from fracturing were demonstrated the last time { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] fighters feared their leader may have been killed.According to Noman Benotman, a former { Libyan } [ Libya ] jihadist and now a senior analyst at the { Quilliam Foundation } [ Quilliam (think tank) ], a UK counterterrorism think tank, about 150 Arab fighters, including a strong { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] contingent, fled to { Gardez } [ Gardez ] in the mountains of eastern { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] around the time bin Laden's { Tora Bora } [ Tora Bora ] refuge was being carpet-bombed by { American } [ United States ] { B-52s } [ Boeing B-52 Stratofortress ] in December 2001.Benotman, who was in touch at the time with { Libyan } [ Libya ] fighters in { Gardez } [ Gardez ], said that no sooner had the group reached the safety of the town than infighting broke out among { Egyptians } [ Egypt ], { Saudis } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Uzbeks } [ Uzbeks ] and { Libyans } [ Libya ], and between { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] members and fighters from other groups, over who should assume command.The fact that under { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s bylaws, members of the terrorist organization will now have to swear a personal \"bayat,\" or oath of allegiance, to al-Zawahiri just like they did in the past to { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] may be too much to stomach for some of the group's { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] and { Yemeni } [ Yemen ] members.Al Qaeda's internal constitution provides near-total authority to the organization's emir, giving him alone the powers to appoint a deputy and members of the { Shura Council } [ Consultative Council of Al-Qaeda ], though in the last resort it states that the { Shura Council } [ Consultative Council of Al-Qaeda ] can depose the emir if he \"deviates from adhering to the { Islamic } [ Islam ] laws, or when he loses his competence. Although the { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] may not be as charismatic or unifying a leader as { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ], he is one of the few { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] leaders with a reputation for strategic cuing and vision. During the { Iraqi insurgency } [ Iraqi insurgency (2003\u20132011) ], for example, { al-Zawahiri } [ Nasr al-Zawahiri ] tried in vain to persuade { Abu Musab al-Zarqawi } [ Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ] to tone down his barbaric violence, realizing that it would create a backlash against { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ].One of { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdel Nasser al-Zawahiri ]'s most important immediate decisions as leader would be whom to choose as the new deputy leader of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]In terms of seniority, one of the strongest contenders for this position would be { Saif al-Adel } [ Saif al-Adel ], a former { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] army lieutenant and long-time member of al-Zawahiri's { Egyptian Islamic Jihad } [ Egyptian Islamic Jihad ] group. He is believed to have returned to the tribal areas of { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] last year after a period of { house arrest } [ House arrest ] in { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ]According to a former { jihadist } [ Jihadism ], Adel is believed to currently occupy the \"chief of staff\" position within { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ], managing insurgent paramilitary operations in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, with a special remit to manage the group's relations with other { Jihadist } [ Jihadism ] groups and affiliates.However, appointing a fellow { Egyptian } [ Egypt ] might only increase factionalism within { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]According to Benotman, who met al-Adel in 2000 in { Kandahar } [ Kandahar ], a dispute flared up between al-Adel and { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] members of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] while the organization was based in Taliban-run { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], forcing bin Laden to transfer al-Adel from leadership of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s military committee to its security committee. Also, the loss of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] leader may already have had a chilling effect on the group's fundraising efforts in the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] region.Al-Zawahiri may, therefore, appoint a non- {Egyptian } [ Egypt ] to the deputy leadership position.One contender would be Abu Yahya al-Libi, a { Libyan } [ Libya ] jihadist who made his name by escaping from { Bagram Air Base } [ Bagram Airfield ] in 2005. In recent yeas, al-Libi has emerged as one of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] {'s } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] lead ideologues and propagandists, releasing a series of videos calling for new recruits.According to former { jihadists } [ Jihadism ], al-Libi's charismatic { Arab-language } [ Arab language ] speeches are particularly popular among a younger generation of militants across the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world. However, { Benotman } [ Abdelkader Benotman ] -- the former { Libyan } [ Libya ] { Jihadist } [ Jihadism ] commander whose group included al-Libi as a junior member -- does not believe that al-Libi yet has the stature or track record as a fighter needed for promotion to a top leadership position.A dark horse for the deputy leadership position may be { Ilyas Kashmiri } [ Ilyas Kashmiri ], a veteran { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] { jihadist } [ Jihadism ] who recently became part of { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s top leadership. Kashmiri is currently the head { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s 313 brigade, a group based in the tribal areas of { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. He has threatened attacks overseas similar to the { Mumbai } [ Mumbai ] hotel attacks at the end of 2009, in which more than 200 people were killed. That operation was carried out by the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] { militant } [ Militant ] group { Lashkar-e-Tayyiba } [ Lashkar-e-Tayyiba ] {. } [ Lashkar-e-Tayyiba ]The elevation of Kashmiri would have the advantage of further strengthening ties between { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] jihadist groups such as the { Pakistani Taliban } [ Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ], Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and { Jaish-e-Mohammed } [ Jaish-e-Mohammed ].Underlining the close ties between { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] jihadist groups and { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ], the { Pakistani Taliban } [ Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ] have vowed to launch an attack in the { United States } [ United States ] to avenge bin Laden's death. The { Pakistan Taliban } [ Taliban ] have already been involved in one attempted attack in the { United States } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ] Faisal Shahzad, one of the group's recruits, attempted to detonate a car bomb in { New York } [ New York City ]'s { Times Square } [ Times Square ] on May 1, 2010, exactly a year before { Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {'s } [ Osama bin Laden ] death. Despite its many relocations and affiliations, { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] has remained an { Arab-centric } [ Arab world ] group.U.S. military drone targets Al-Awlaki in { Yemen } [ Yemen ] {American } [ United States ] cleric { Anwar al-Awlaki } [ Anwar al-Awlaki ] is unlikely to be promoted to a leadership position within al Qaeda \"Central\" as he is based in { Yemen } [ Yemen ] rather than { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. Though al-Awlaki has emerged as a powerful charismatic preacher for { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s cause and an important figure within { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] in the { Arabian Peninsula } [ Arabian Peninsula ], he possesses none of the combat track record that { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] members over the years have so prized in their leaders. Moreover, { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdelkader al-Zawahiri ] is very unlikely to reward somebody he has never met with a key leader or entertain the risk of being upstaged by the { American } [ United States ] {. } [ United States ]In the end, { al-Zawahiri } [ Al-Zawahiri ]'s accession may be short-lived. The \"treasure trove\" of documents, thumb drives and computer discs found in { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {'s compound } [ Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad ] may provide { American } [ United States ] intelligence with crucial clues about his whereabouts. According to { Western } [ Western world ] officials, intelligence has suggested { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] and { al-Zawahiri } [ Abdelkader al-Zawahiri ] continued to communicate in recent years and were possibly in relatively close geographic proximity.'."}, {"cnn/training/46e13b910c4bc23ef1582eecbacab852975e8e73": "The wife of an accused { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] operative captured by { U. } [ United States ]S. forces told { CNN } [ CNN ] that masked men ambushed her husband when he was on the way home from morning prayers.While { U. } [ United States ]S.

The { investigation } [ Criminal investigation ] is on-going as to who is responsible. That being said, we do know that { Islamic } [ Islam ] { extremists } [ Extremism ] participated in the violent demonstrations.\"The second { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] change was to the swap out the word \"attacks\" with \"demonstrations\" in the first bullet point, which an administration source said was to eliminate an awkward and illogical account of events.A third change the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] made was to remove the name { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] from the second talking point, which was done because it didn't want to get ahead of the { FBI } [ Federal Bureau of Investigation ]'s investigation of the attack.A key point of contention revolves around statements by { U. } [ United States ]N. { Ambassador } [ Ambassador ] { Susan Rice } [ Susan Rice ], who took the most direct criticism because of her assertions in television interviews days after the attack that linked it to the demonstration.'Shredded bodies' in 'horrific' { Benghazi } [ Benghazi ] blast {State Department } [ United States Department of State ] concernA final { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] addition to the talking points was a warning about the security situation at the time of the armed assault.

But most women still need what they need,\" she adds.When it comes to her role in an industry which has been heavily criticized for making women feel self-conscious, Brown says: \"Everyone I know in the beauty industry, not just the people that work in my company, is really there to make products that make women look and feel better, they devote their lives to it. I think the biggest problem is that the { Internet } [ Internet ] now shows everything. So if you are going to be an { actress } [ Actor ] or a { supermodel } [ Supermodel ], you are unusually photogenic, you are unusually thin, that is not what all women are,\" she says.Brown still beautifies the faces of { models } [ Model (person) ] in all her { advertising } [ Advertising ] campaigns, but her business interests are not limited to { cosmetics } [ Cosmetics ] {. } [ Cosmetics ]She has partnered with { Safilo } [ Safilo ], a leading { Italian } [ Italy ] eyewear brand, to design a range of glasses, and has recently been appointed as Editor-in-Chief of { Yahoo } [ Yahoo! ]'s new beauty section.Read more: The dress that launched a $7 billion empire\"I'm trying to create a space that is empowering, that's teaching, that's fun, with a sense of humor, that's visually exciting and cool,\" she says, \"but mostly, a place that will give women real answers to not just beauty but lifestyle and empowerment, and everything it means to be a successful, happy woman. And I hope a man, too, I have things plaed for men as well,\" { Brown } [ Robert Brown (British author) ] adds.The { entrepreneur } [ Entrepreneurship ] has also chaeled her energy into { philanthropy } [ Philanthropy ], starting the Pretty Powerful Campaign for Women and Girls, where 100% of the purchase price of a limited edition product goes to programs helping disadvantaged women and girls around the world.The company also sponsors Dress for Success, a global charity which offers unemployed women career advice and professional attire for job interviews.Brown's youthful face and eyes exude humor, and she fosters a homey atmosphere in her headquarters in { New York } [ New York City ]'s trendy { SoHo } [ SoHo, Manhattan ].

And gunmen kidnapped two female { Czech } [ Czech Republic ] tourists in southwestern { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] {. } [ Pakistan ]But this past week also saw more than a glimmer of good news from { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]: Saturday, March 16 marked an extraordinary moment in { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] history, as this is the first time  a civilian government has served its entire five-year term (from { 2008 } [ 2008 Pakistani general election ] to { 2013 } [ 2013 Pakistani general election ]). And, for the first time in its history, the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] { military } [ Pakistan Armed Forces ] appears unwilling to mount a { coup } [ Coup d'\u00e9tat ] against the { civilian } [ Civilian ] government. The { military } [ Pakistan Armed Forces ] has successfully executed three { coups } [ Coup d'\u00e9tat ] and attempted a number of others since { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]'s { independence } [ Partition of India ] in 1947.Today the army understands that the most recent { coup } [ Coup d'\u00e9tat ] by General { Pervez Musharraf } [ Pervez Musharraf ] who took power in 1999 has tarnished its brand.Musharraf hung on to power for almost a decade and his imposition of emergency rule in 2007 triggered massive street protests and eventually his ouster.On Saturday, Musharaf aounced he is returning to { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] from self-imposed { exile } [ Exile ] on March 24 to run in elections that are to be held two months from now.In a telling sign that { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] is moving into something of a new era, { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] military officials are not supportive of { Musharraf } [ Pervez Musharraf ]'s return and nor is much of the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] public.On May 11, { Pakistanis } [ Pakistanis ] will go to the polls to elect a new { civilian } [ Civilian ] government for a five-year term, and there is now a good prospect for continued, uninterrupted { civilian } [ Civilian ] government until at least 2018.In terms of { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]'s long-term health and stability, the fact that the country is in an unprecedented era of lengthy civilian rule will help erode the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] military's present position as having uncontested supremacy in all matters that relate to the country's national security, in particular its relations with { India } [ India ] and with { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ].The military has backed { insurgent } [ Insurgency ] and { terrorist } [ Terrorism ] groups in { India } [ India ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] to maintain its perceived interests in these countries. A more confident civilian { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] government will, hopefully, over time be less likely to support these militant groups.Another great opportunity (and potential peril) will present itself in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], when { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ] go to the polls in April 2014 for the third presidential election since the fall of the { Taliban } [ Taliban ].If that election is perceived as being relatively free and fair this would go a long way to ease tensions in the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] body politic, increase { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ]'s overall security and reassure both { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] and outside investors that the country has a promising future.The { United States } [ United States ], therefore, should do everything it can to provide technical and { security } [ Security ] assistance to make these { elections } [ Election ] go as well as possible.But unlike what happened in the run-up to the { 2009 Afghan presidential election } [ 2009 Afghan presidential election ] {, } [ United States ] { U. } [ United States ]S. officials should not get involved in privately backing certain candidates. This private support had the unintended effect of splitting the opposition to { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] President { Hamid Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ], as key leaders of the anti-Karzai opposition all believed they were \" {America } [ United States ]'s candidate.\" It also deeply alienated { Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ], whose occasional diatribes against the { United States } [ United States ] are best understood as due to his lingering resentment over this issue.A key aspect of { U. } [ United States ]S. and { NATO } [ NATO ] plaing for the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] presidential elections in April 2014 is that given the fact that there are no discernible front-ruers to succeed { Karzai } [ Hamid Karzai ], there may be no clear wier who attains more than 50% of the vote, which under { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] electoral laws would necessitate a runoff election between the two leading candidates.Security, technical and economic assistance for the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] elections should be prepared to extend into  summer 2014, because it is not clear as yet when that runoff might be held.Last year the { United States } [ United States ] and { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] negotiated a Strategic Partnership Agreement, which ensures { America } [ United States ] will continue to play a supporting role there until 2024.The exact details of what that agreement means in practice are still being hammered out (according to { U. } [ United States ]S.S. aid but also many thousands of { American } [ United States ] soldiers stationed in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] for years into the future as a guarantor of the country's stability.The { U. } [ United States ]S. military has given { President } [ President of the United States ] { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] a range of options under which as few as 6,000 or as many as 20,000 soldiers would remain in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] after 2014.Whatever the final decision is on troop levels, the key point is that the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration and other { U. } [ United States ]S. officials should emphasize very clearly that the thousands of { American } [ United States ] soldiers who will remain in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] are there to support the { United States } [ United States ]' long-term partnership agreement with { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] -- and that its life extends well beyond 2014.This is important to emphasize, because { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ] have been understandably confused by some of the different signals the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration has made about its commitment to { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] in the past.Major confusion arose after { President } [ President of the United States ] { Obama } [ Barack Obama ]'s December 2009 aouncement of the \"surge\" of 30,000 troops to { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], which was coupled with the aouncement that those troops would begin to withdraw begiing in July 2011. In many { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ]' minds, the withdrawal date became more important than the fact that during his first term { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] actually tripled the number of { U. } [ United States ]S. soldiers in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] from around 30,000 to a total of 90,000.When the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration aounces the number of soldiers who will remain in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] post-2014, it should emphasize that the { U. } [ United States ]S. commitment to { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] is set to last until at least 2024.This will help in multiple ways: First, this guarantee of a long-term { U. } [ United States ]S. commitment to { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] will encourage other { NATO } [ NATO ] countries to maintain some of their own troops in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] to work with the { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ] in areas like training the army and police past the end of the { NATO } [ NATO ] combat mission in December 2014.Such an aouncement will also help reassure { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ] that the { United States } [ United States ] won't be simply turning off the lights in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] in December 2014. And it will signal to regional powers like { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] and { Iran } [ Iran ] that the { United States } [ United States ] plans to remain engaged in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] for many years into the future.A key issue facing the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] government as the { United States } [ United States ] draws down its forces is how will the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] economy fare? Should the economy collapse, the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] government's ability to deal with security issues would be substantially eroded. Already, rents in { Kabul } [ Kabul ] are tumbling and { nongovernmental organizations } [ Non-governmental organization ] are laying off staff.Surprisingly, however, a rigorous and comprehensive { World Bank } [ World Bank ] study last year found that { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] will continue to have a healthy growth rate, dropping from its present robust 9% a year rate \"to closer to 5% on average until 2018.\" (The { U. } [ United States ]S.)The economic contraction as the { United States } [ United States ] draws down is likely to be less severe than might be supposed, partly because the hundreds of billions that the { U. } [ United States ]S. military has spent in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] over the past decade is spending that almost entirely benefits the { United States } [ United States ].The { World Bank } [ World Bank ] study points out that \"military spending by the { United States } [ United States ] (and other countries) finances the salaries of military persoel, investments in weapons equipment and systems. The impact of its withdrawal is therefore likely to be muted.\"Another encouraging sign is the investigation of the troubled { Kabul Bank } [ Kabul Bank ], in which some $900 million was lost to fraud, indicating that the culture of impunity for corrupt { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] officials might be begiing to erode. Earlier this month, 21 officials were found guilty of { fraud } [ Fraud ] and two of the former heads of the { bank } [ Bank ] were sentenced to five years in { prison } [ Prison ]. The { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] Attorney General's office said last week that it would appeal the sentences as being too soft given the scale of the fraud.A key question is the extent to which the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] army and police can operate effectively against the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] as the { United States } [ United States ] withdraws. As yet the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] army hasn't shown the ability to conduct large-scale operations without significant { American } [ United States ] support. In addition, a big issue for the { army } [ Army ] is the extraordinarily high { attrition } [ Attrition warfare ] rate.Today, a little more then a quarter of the { recruits } [ Military recruitment ] to the { army } [ Army ] drop out every year. Because of this high dropout rate, { NATO } [ NATO ] is now considering maintaining the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] army and { police } [ Afghan National Police ] at its present large size of 352,000 men through 2018. (Estimates of the size of the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] typically are in the 25,000 range.)One indicator of the increasingly { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ]-led nature of the fight against the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] is the fact that some 300 { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] soldiers and policemen are now dying every month in the war, while in January three { U. } [ United States ]S. soldiers were killed, which was the lowest number of any month during the previous four years.On { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] has some important common goals with the { United States } [ United States ], { NATO } [ NATO ] and { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ] themselves. { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] does not want to see { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] collapse into a renewed civil war, which would destabilize { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], nor does it want to see the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] in charge of the country again.When the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] was in power in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] the group resisted { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] efforts at control, while the Pakistani Taliban have killed many thousands inside { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ]. These basic shared goals, no civil war and no { Taliban } [ Taliban ] control of { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ], can help to create the conditions for a successful post-2014 { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] {Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] also wants a Pashtun-led government in { Kabul } [ Kabul ] and for the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] to have some representation in the south and the east. These are also goals the { Afghans } [ Afghanistan ] can live with.Karzai is, after all, a { Pashtun } [ Pashtuns ] and given the fact that { Pashtuns } [ Pashtuns ] are the largest ethnic group, the next president of { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] almost certainly will be a { Pashtun } [ Pashtuns ]. And other ethnic minorities can live with a situation in which the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] assume a number of provincial and district governorships providing they lay down their arms, join the political process and recognize the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] constitution.According to a senior { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] government official, numerous discussions between representatives of the { Taliban } [ Taliban ] and the { Afghan } [ Afghanistan ] government have taken place over the past years to discuss such a political accommodation, although, so far, not much of anything has come of these talks.Note: This story is adapted from testimony by { Peter Bergen } [ Peter Bergen ] delivered to the { House Foreign Affairs Committee } [ United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs ] on March 19, 2013.'."}, {"cnn/training/31df527794629849d47bef5993f571564a54eac4": "(CNN) -- { Ted Haggard } [ Ted Haggard ], the former { megachurch } [ Megachurch ] pastor and former { National Association of Evangelicals } [ National Association of Evangelicals ] chief whose career was undone by a sex and drugs scandal in 2006, will appear in a { cable TV } [ Cable television ] special this month.\" {Ted Haggard } [ Ted Haggard ]: Scandalous\" will explore his fall from grace, he said. { Haggard } [ Haggard (film) ] described the { scandal } [ Scandal ] as \"highly embarrassing and shameful for me.\"The show is scheduled to air on { TLC } [ TLC (TV network) ] on January 16.In 2006, Haggard acknowledged having received a { massage } [ Massage ] from a { Denver } [ Denver ] {, Colorado } [ Colorado ], man who said that the prominent { pastor } [ Pastor ] had paid him for sex over three years.Haggard also admitted he had bought { methamphetamine } [ Methamphetamine ] but said he threw it away.Those statements led the Board of Overseers at { New Life Church } [ New Life Church (New York City) ] to fire Haggard as senior { pastor } [ Pastor ].

The only discovery were thousands of { golf } [ Golf ] balls 300 feet down and 100 yards off the shore.No mystery there, though: Locals and { tourists } [ Tourism ] have been known to practice their { golf } [ Golf ] swing there for years.Was the { Shroud of Turin } [ Shroud of Turin ] the burial cloth for { Jesus } [ Jesus ]?The { Shroud of Turin } [ Shroud of Turin ] may be the most famous religious { relic } [ Relic ].Some { Christians } [ Christianity ] believe the { shroud } [ Shroud ], which appears to bear the imprint of a man's body, to be { Jesus Christ } [ Jesus ] {'s } [ Jesus ] burial cloth. The body appears to have wounds that match those the { Bible } [ Bible ] describes as having been suffered by { Jesus } [ Jesus ] on the { cross } [ Cross ].Many scholars contest the shroud's authenticity, saying it dates to the { Middle Ages } [ Middle Ages ], when many purported { biblical } [ Bible ] relics -- such as splinters from { Jesus } [ Jesus ]' cross -- surfaced across { Europe } [ Europe ].Just before stepping aside as { Pope } [ Pope ] a year ago, { Benedict XVI } [ Pope Benedict XVI ] authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from { Turin Cathedral } [ Turin Cathedral ], where the mysterious { Christian } [ Christianity ] relic is kept out of sight in a bulletproof, climate-controlled glass case.'."}, {"cnn/training/30b57f8b68514dc31443c52c7db5c57243d59936": "LONDON, { England } [ England ] (CNN) -- It wasn't so long ago that { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] were being heralded as the savior of the planet and a thoroughly green solution to our climate woes. But fair winds have been replaced by persistent storms of criticism. But is it justified? { Principal Voices } [ Principal Voices ] has spoken to three people -- an { economist } [ Economist ], a { scientist } [ Scientist ] and an { environmental } [ Environmentalism ] campaigner -- at the heart of the biofuels debate. Have yours at bottom of the page.The { British } [ United Kingdom ] countryside is transformed in the spring by swathes of { rapeseed } [ Rapeseed ] {. } [ Rapeseed ]The Economist {Keith Wiebe } [ Keith Wiebe ] is the service chief in the Economic and Social Development Department at the { Food and Agriculture Organization } [ Food and Agriculture Organization ] of the { United Nations } [ United Nations ] ( {FAO } [ Food and Agriculture Organization ]). He is currently working on the { FAO } [ Food and Agriculture Organization ] Aual Report into the state of food and agriculture which this year is focusing on { biofuels } [ Biofuel ]. The report will be published in September 2008.Biofuels are obviously playing a role in the current food situation. It is a new source of { demand } [ Demand ] that has risen dramatically over the past couple of years. This has been a significant factor in the increase in { commodities } [ Commodity ] prices recently.What's unique about the past year or two and particularly the past few months is the convergence of a whole number of factors on both the { supply } [ Supply (economics) ] side and the { demand } [ Demand ] side.The background is that you've had the gradually increasing { income } [ Income ] and { demand } [ Demand ] for more, and different types of { food } [ Food ] in { emerging economies } [ Emerging market ]. You've had a gradual decline in international stocks of { food } [ Food ], you've got higher { oil } [ Oil ] prices which means the costs of { production } [ Production (economics) ] are going up. There have been some been some production setbacks in a couple of key export countries such as { Australia } [ Australia ] and also a rapid increase in demand for { maize } [ Maize ] and vegetable oils for { biodiesel } [ Biodiesel ] and { ethanol } [ Ethanol ] production.All these factors interact and lead to policy responses from countries to limit { exports } [ Export ] of { commodities } [ Commodity ] to protect their domestic { consumers } [ Consumer ]. It's impossible to disentangle a specific portion or to attribute a particular portion to the price increases.One thing to keep in mind is that { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] play a role in the current high prices but they are certainly not the only factor. The other thing is that they have adverse short term impact on food prices. They have an adverse impact on poor { consumers } [ Consumer ] particularly in { developing countries } [ Developing country ] {. } [ Developing country ] But there is an opportunity over the longer term at least for small { farmers } [ Farmer ] who do have access to resources to adjust their production patterns. And high prices give them an { incentive } [ Incentive ] to do exactly that.Small { farmers } [ Farmer ] in { developing countries } [ Developing country ] see these price incentives and they see they would like to respond.I think it is important to distinguish between different types of { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] {. } [ Biofuel ] They have very different characteristics. Brazilian { sugar cane } [ Sugarcane ] is the classic example of a type of { biofuel } [ Biofuel ] that is now performing efficiently and competitively. They are alone among all the major { biofuel } [ Biofuel ] foodstocks in being competitive at market prices. Whereas in the { U. } [ United States ]S., { maize } [ Maize ] continues to cost more to produce it than it does to be competitive with the { fossil fuel } [ Fossil fuel ] counterpart.There is a lot of potential in second generation cellulosic technologies but they are not yet commercially viable but that point is coming closer every day. There is so much effort which has gone into this recently and if there is a silver lining to the whole situation it is that people are looking everywhere for alternatives.Two years ago the general perspective on { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] was that they were a very bright prospect and to say anything negative about them was somehow a suspect analysis. This situation has been completely reversed.Certainly there are things that need to be reevaluated and looked at very carefully. There is also the potential if { policies } [ Policy ] can be improved and { investment } [ Investment ] can be made in { agriculture } [ Agriculture ]. Many of the world's poor depend on { agriculture } [ Agriculture ] for their livelihood. We don't want to throw out an opportunity for them.The ScientistDr { Richard Pike } [ Richard Pike (chemist) ] is the { chief executive } [ Chief executive officer ] of the { Royal Society of Chemistry } [ Royal Society of Chemistry ] {. } [ Royal Society of Chemistry ] Prior to taking up the role in 2006 he spent 20 years working in the { oil industry } [ Petroleum industry ] {. } [ Oil ] He recently calculated that a one-way { transatlantic flight } [ Transatlantic flight ] would require one year's { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] yield from an area the size of 30 { football pitches } [ Football pitch ].Biofuels will clearly have an application at a local level. I think there is a general view that at a very local level -- and I'm talking of small { townships } [ Township ] that are surrounded by land that could cultivate { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] -- that it is probably { sustainable } [ Sustainability ].Whether it can be applied on a large scale in a { sustainable } [ Sustainability ] way will vary tremendously from { country } [ Country ] to { country } [ Country ]. But one has to be very careful about projecting into the future.For instance in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] there is a lot of talk about { biofuels } [ Biofuel ], but one of the big issues is the very low efficiency in converting sunlight into the { oil } [ Oil ] or { ethanol } [ Ethanol ] that you would use to fill up your tank. Typically the { efficiency } [ Efficiency ] is considerably less than half a percent. If, on the one hand, you've got { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] which represent only a half a percent conversion of sunlight, and let's say you've got { photovoltaic cells } [ Photovoltaics ] and concentrated solar power systems, the efficiency of solar in terms of pure conversion is 50-100 times greater.In the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], for every one percent of { diesel } [ Diesel fuel ] and { petrol } [ Gasoline ] you want to replace with { biofuel } [ Biofuel ] you need, in big round numbers, about one percent of the land area of the { UK } [ United Kingdom ]. That's a very stuing statistic. And it means that if you're looking at notions of { self-sufficiency } [ Self-sustainability ] then it's completely out of the window.If the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] wanted to be more { biofuel } [ Biofuel ] orientated it would have to { import } [ Import ] it. Currently the { European Union } [ European Union ] directive is to have 5.75 percent { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] by 2010. If the { UK } [ United Kingdom ] was to provide that for itself, five percent of the land would have to be utilized -- which is an extraordinary number. That excludes things like the { carbon footprint } [ Carbon footprint ] of { fertilizers } [ Fertilizer ], { harvesting } [ Harvest ] and { distribution } [ Distribution (marketing) ]. The figures you see in the { press } [ News media ] tend to be focused on the yield from the ground rather than thinking of the bigger picture.There is a real need to look at the big picture and there's a risk that the focus on { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] and the idea that it could offer quite a significant contribution is distracting from some of the more important things that need to be looked at. There are lots of small initiatives, either at the { user } [ User (computing) ] end -- e.g. turning off stand-by switches, drinking { tap water } [ Tap water ] -- or the { supply } [ Water supply ] end -- e.g. wind energy, tidal energy.What people are forgetting is that if you look at the { energy } [ Energy ] balance of the world, 80 percent of the world's { energy } [ Energy ] is supplied by { fossil fuels } [ Fossil fuel ] {. } [ Fossil fuel ] That is likely to remain unchanged for a long time. Fossil fuels are not going to run out that quickly. Reserves figures that you see quoted are very conservative.The other thing about { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] is what I call the problem of { unintended consequences } [ Unintended consequences ] {. } [ Unintended consequences ] Biofuels are clearly going down a route that is bringing it into conflict with food crops and { biodiversity } [ Biodiversity ]. People have talked about a much more efficient { biofuel } [ Biofuel ] process involving { algae } [ Algae ] {. } [ Algae ] { Algae } [ Algae ] would have significantly high yields. But then again, I don't think enough people have gone through what might happen if that were pursued. You have to ask how it would affect { marine life } [ Marine life ] {. } [ Marine biology ]The Environmental CampaignerDeepak Rughani is co-director of { Biofuelwatch } [ Biofuelwatch ], a campaign group backing the expanding call for a moratorium on agrofuels* in the { European Union } [ European Union ].Biofuelwatch is currently engaged in a new challenge; to help prevent the first biofuel-fired power station to be built in the UK. If energy company { Blue-ng } [ Blue-ng ] is successful a precedent will have been set and according to { UK } [ United Kingdom ] newspaper, { The Independent } [ The Independent ] another 43 power stations could follow.On June 4th, { Newham } [ London Borough of Newham ] Councilors in east { London } [ London ] will meet to make their recommendation on the proposed plant. Coincidently the meeting marks the second day of the { UN } [ United Nations ]'s High-Level Conference on World Food Security, Climate Change and Bioenergy in { Rome } [ Rome ]. More than 770 organizations and prominent individuals worldwide have signed a { Civil Society } [ Civil society ] statement on the World Food Emergency which calls for a halt to all development of land for agrofuels for cars, planes and for energy production in power stations.So far, only { Germany } [ Germany ] has invested heavily in { vegetable oil } [ Vegetable oil ] { CHP } [ Chlorinated polyethylene ] plants -- 1,800 of them. The vast majority burn { palm oil } [ Palm oil ] because { European } [ Europe ] { vegetable oil } [ Vegetable oil ] is too expensive.According to experts {, } [ Carbon dioxide ] the impact on the { climate } [ Climate ] has been disastrous {. } [ Carbon dioxide ] { Peat } [ Peat ] expert Professor Siegert of { Munich } [ Munich ] University has warned: \"We were able to prove that the making of these plantations and the burning of the rainforests and { peat } [ Peat ] areas emits many thousands of times as much { CO2 } [ Carbon dioxide ] as we then are able to prevent by using { palm oil } [ Palm oil ]. And that is a disastrous balance for the { climate } [ Climate ] {. } [ Climate ]\"Unfortunately, switching to rapeseed oil, even if it was affordable, would not necessarily help matters: As confirmed by a { UN } [ United Nations ] report, { Europe } [ Europe ]'s use of rapeseed oil for { bioenergy } [ Bioenergy ] is one of the main reasons for rising { palm oil } [ Palm oil ] prices linked to shortages in the food and cosmetics markets. Inevitably rising prices make { deforestation } [ Deforestation ] and { peat } [ Peat ] drainage in { South East Asia } [ Southeast Asia ] much more profitable.There are other serious concerns about the east { London } [ London ] proposal: Vegetable oil burning leads to emissions of { NOx } [ NOx ] and particulates -- PM 10 and PM 2.5 -- known to have an adverse effect on the { respiratory } [ Respiratory system ] and { cardiovascular } [ Circulatory system ] system. Areas close to the proposed site are currently being monitored as Air Quality Management areas and many residents are very concerned about the plans.It seems that in the name of decentralized energy generation -- which is likely to be much more efficient than centralized energy generation -- government and companies are willing to both disregard the welfare of local people and at the very time when we need to be dramatically reducing our demand for { vegetable oil } [ Vegetable oil ], offer a new market for agrofuels.By backing false-solutions we stall investment from the true renewable energies such as { wind } [ Wind power ], { solar } [ Solar power ], { wave } [ Wave power ] and { geothermal } [ Geothermal energy ] and ignore our responsibility to prevent crossing key climate tipping points, beyond which our current civilization and even much of life on earth could not sustain itself.* { Agrofuels } [ Agrofuel ] are { biofuels } [ Biofuel ] produced from crops or trees grown in large-scale { monocultures } [ Monoculture ], or agricultural and forest 'waste' which should be returned to the natural system.'."}, {"cnn/training/dc6085373a0631673304a265a44371c9d034898b": "(CNN) -- It's been days since three { Latin American } [ Latin America ] presidents offered to give { Edward Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] a safe place to hide out from { U. } [ United States ]S. authorities.But the man who's admitted leaking { classified } [ Classified information ] documents about { U. } [ United States ]S. surveillance programs remains holed up at { Moscow } [ Moscow ]'s { Sheremetyevo International Airport } [ Sheremetyevo International Airport ]. And the global guessing game over his next steps hasn't stopped.What's the holdup?Out of { Russia } [ Russia ]: { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ]'s optionsSure, we've heard fiery speeches offering asylum from { leftist } [ Left-wing politics ] leaders who are eager to criticize the { United States } [ United States ]. But supporting { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ]'s cause and wanting to make { Uncle Sam } [ Uncle Sam ] look bad aren't the only parts of the equation, with so many trade and diplomatic relations hanging in the balance, said Michael Shifter, president of the { Inter-American Dialogue } [ Inter-American Dialogue ] think tank in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ].\"They want to make a point,\" he said, \"but I think they're concerned about suffering the consequences, which I think would be serious. The { United States } [ United States ] has made that pretty clear.\"Here's a look at the pros and cons that leaders are facing in five { Latin American } [ Latin America ] nations that are among the 27 countries where { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] is seeking { asylum } [ Right of asylum ].VenezuelaPresident { Nicolas Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ] was the first leader to say he'd give { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] asylum. Officials have said they're waiting to hear whether { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] accepts the offer.Pros:xe2x80xa2 Maduro regularly alleges U.S.S. { government } [ Government ] of trying to destabilize his country and even suggested that { U. } [ United States ]S. officials may have infected late { Venezuelan } [ Venezuela ] leader { Hugo Chavez } [ Hugo Ch\u00e1vez ] with the { cancer } [ Cancer ] that eventually killed him. Taking in a high-profile { fugitive } [ Fugitive ] wanted in the { United States } [ United States ] would give him another platform to criticize the country.xe2x80xa2 It's been months since the death of { Chavez } [ Ch\u00e1vez ], who earned major political points at home and a place in the global spotlight with his fierce criticisms of { America } [ United States ], including a notorious { United Nations General Assembly } [ United Nations General Assembly ] speech where he called President { George W. } [ George W. W. ] Bush the { devil } [ Devil ] {. } [ Devil ] Maduro describes himself as { Chavez } [ Ch\u00e1vez ] {'s } [ Ch\u00e1vez ] son. But while he might have the same { speechwriters } [ Speechwriter ] as his predecessor, he doesn't have the same { charisma } [ Charisma ] {, } [ Charisma ] and it seems like fewer people are listening to his words. Giving { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] asylum would be politically popular in { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ], shoring up support for { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ] among { Chavez } [ Nicol\u00e1s Chavez ] loyalists.xe2x80xa2 It also has { regional } [ Region ] and { global } [ World ] implications. \"This for { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ], I think, really provides an opportunity for him to show himself on the world stage as a regional leader, as the true successor of { Chavez } [ Nicol\u00e1s Chavez ] {,\" } [ Nicol\u00e1s Chavez ] said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.Cons:xe2x80xa2 Relations with the { United States } [ United States ] have been slowly thawing since { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ] {'s } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ] election in April. Last month {, } [ Miami ] things were looking up when { U. } [ United States ]S. Secretary of State { John Kerry } [ John Kerry ] met with { Venezuelan } [ Venezuela ] Foreign Minister { Elias Jaua } [ Elias Jaua ]. That would change if { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] granted { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] to { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ]. \"This will clearly freeze the warming of relations with { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] {,\" } [ Venezuela ] Smilde said.xe2x80xa2 Despite years of tense Venezuela-U.S. relations, economic ties between the two countries remain strong. Imports and exports between the { United States } [ United States ] and { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] totaled more than $56 billion last year, according to the { U. } [ United States ]S. Census Bureau. Venezuela's state-run oil company makes tens of billions of dollars aually from exports to the { United States } [ United States ]. { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] is the { United States } [ United States ]' fourth-largest supplier of imported { crude oil } [ Petroleum ], according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Would offering { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] put that relationship in jeopardy? { It } [ Information technology ] might. But this isn't the first time { Venezuela } [ Venezuela ] has run afoul of the { United States } [ United States ]. Smilde argues that in offering { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] { asylum } [ Right of asylum ], { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ] gains more than he loses.Shifter says it's unclear whether the benefits are worth the costs.BoliviaPresident { Evo Morales } [ Evo Morales ] says he's furious about what happened last week with his presidential jet, which had to land in { Austria } [ Austria ] after { European } [ Europe ] countries allegedly closed their airspace amid suspicions that { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] was aboard. Now { Morales } [ Morales (activist) ] says he's willing to give { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] as a \"fair protest\" of the incident.Pros:xe2x80xa2 { Morales } [ Morales ] has long slammed what he calls { U. } [ United States ]S. { imperialism } [ Imperialism ], kicking out the { Drug Enforcement Administration } [ Drug Enforcement Administration ], the { U. } [ United States ]S. { ambassador } [ Ambassador ], and the { U. } [ United States ]S. Agency for International Development. Accepting { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] would fall in line with the { Bolivian } [ Bolivia ] president's argument that his country would be better off without any { U. } [ United States ]S. interference. And in terms of its relationship with the { United States } [ United States ], { Bolivia } [ Bolivia ] has little goodwill left to lose.xe2x80xa2 The { United States } [ United States ]' trade ties with { Bolivia } [ Bolivia ] are weaker than its links with other countries in the region. \" {Bolivia } [ Bolivia ]'s a country that I think has the least real economic interest with the { United States } [ United States ] {,\" } [ United States ] Shifter said.Cons:xe2x80xa2 Still, there's some economic coection. Exports and imports between the { United States } [ United States ] and { Bolivia } [ Bolivia ] totaled more than $2.4 billion last year, according to the { U. } [ United States ]S. Census Bureau.xe2x80xa2 Despite { Morales } [ Evo Morales ]' fierce criticism of { European } [ Europe ] countries and the { United States } [ United States ] after the plane incident, Shifter said, it's unclear whether he really wants { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] to come to { Bolivia } [ Bolivia ].NicaraguaPresident { Daniel Ortega } [ Daniel Ortega ] says his country will grant { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] to { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] \"if circumstances permit.\" Was that a way to sound supportive, but give himself a way out? It's unclear.Pros:xe2x80xa2 Like { Maduro } [ Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ] and { Morales } [ Evo Morales ], Ortega is a vocal critic of the { United States } [ United States ], and his allegations of { U. } [ United States ]S. imperialism play well with his supporters.Cons:xe2x80xa2 Business is big for { Ortega } [ \u00d3rtega ]'s government, and it's about to get a lot bigger. { Chinese } [ China ] investors and { Nicaraguan } [ Nicaragua ] leaders have just signed a deal to build a $40 billion { canal } [ Canal ] through the country. Does that mean { Nicaragua } [ Nicaragua ] is now looking { East } [ East ] but not { West } [ West ] when it comes to business? Quite the opposite, Shifter said. \"I think the { canal } [ Canal ] project is another factor that makes them even more interested in staying on the good side of the { United States } [ United States ] {,\" } [ United States ] he said.xe2x80xa2 That's not all. Exports and imports between the { United States } [ United States ] and { Nicaragua } [ Nicaragua ] totaled more than $3.8 billion last year, according to the { U. } [ United States ]S. Census Bureau. And { Nicaragua } [ Nicaragua ] gets trade preferences from the { United States } [ United States ]. \"Rhetorically, at times, he's confrontational, but behind the scenes, he's making deals.\"EcuadorSnowden set his sights on { Ecuador } [ Ecuador ] with his first { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] request after leaving { Hong Kong } [ Hong Kong ] on June 23. President { Rafael Correa } [ Rafael Correa ] railed against the { United States } [ United States ] in fiery speeches over the issue earlier this month. But the government has said it's still weighing the request, but can't act until { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ]'s in { Ecuadorian } [ Ecuador ] territory. Some speculate that the delay in getting a clear response from { Ecuador } [ Ecuador ] is what inspired { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] to apply for { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] in dozens more countries.Pros:xe2x80xa2 { Ecuador } [ Ecuador ] granted asylum to { WikiLeaks } [ WikiLeaks ] founder { Julian Assange } [ Julian Assange ] last year, and has touted the decision as a clear sign that the { South American } [ South America ] nation is a defender of human rights. Giving { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] would give officials another platform to make that case.xe2x80xa2 Defiant authorities in { Ecuador } [ Ecuador ] said last month that they wouldn't bow to { U. } [ United States ]S.S. officials couldn't manipulate them.Cons:xe2x80xa2 When { Ecuadorian } [ Ecuador ] officials said they didn't need { U. } [ United States ]S. trade preferences, business leaders issued a swift response: Not so fast. \"Correa is a guy who on the one hand, he's very defiant of the { United States } [ United States ] and wants to be the rhetorical leader of the { left } [ Left-wing politics ] in { Latin America } [ Latin America ] {,\" } [ Latin America ] Shifter said. \"On the other hand, he's got a very broad coalition in { Ecuador } [ Ecuador ] and is trying to be more pragmatic and attract foreign investment.\"xe2x80xa2 After speaking with { U. } [ United States ]S. { Vice President } [ Vice President of the United States ] { Joe Biden } [ Joe Biden ] last month, { Correa } [ Andrea Correa ] adopted a more measured tone. \"We have to act very carefully but with courage,\" he said, \"without contradicting our principles but with a lot of care, responsibility and respect, of course, towards the { U. } [ United States ]S. but also respect for the truth.\"CubaPresident { Raul Castro } [ Raul Castro ] hasn't shied away from talking about the { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] case. He's hailed the former { National Security Agency } [ National Security Agency ] contractor's revelations and stressed that he supports fellow { Latin American } [ Latin America ] countries' right to grant { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] { asylum } [ Right of asylum ]. But there are two key things he hasn't said: whether { Cuba } [ Cuba ] will grant { asylum } [ Right of asylum ] to { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] and whether he'd allow a plane carrying the { U. } [ United States ]S. intelligence leaker to make a stopover in { Cuba } [ Cuba ] on the way to { South America } [ South America ].Pros:xe2x80xa2 Decades of hostile relations between the { United States } [ United States ] and { Cuba } [ Cuba ] and a tough economic embargo could mean that { Cuba } [ Cuba ] would have less to lose than other { Latin American } [ Latin America ] nations when it comes to granting asylum. With so many sanctions in place, said Philip Peters, president of the Cuba Research Center in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ], \"I don't know what more the { United States } [ United States ] could add.\"xe2x80xa2 Official media in { Cuba } [ Cuba ] have painted { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] as a hero. { Cuba } [ Cuba ] could decide to step in, Shifter said, \"if there's an issue where it would have to do with { Latin American } [ Latin America ] pride and dignity and sovereignty.\"xe2x80xa2 While granting { Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] asylum might be a step too far, letting a coecting flight carrying him land in { Cuba } [ Cuba ] might be an option. \"But I think it would make them uneasy.\"Cons:xe2x80xa2 There are signs that { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] {'s } [ United States ] relationship with { Havana } [ Havana ] is improving, such as a recent agreement to hold talks over bringing back direct mail between the two nations. And { Cuba } [ Cuba ] is hopeful about more developments in { U. } [ United States ]S.

Open at { Oakmont } [ Oakmont, Illinois ], in his home state of { Pesylvania } [ P\u00e9p\u00e9lvania ], despite going into the tournament as a heavy favorite.An eventual loss in an 18-hole play off to the 22-year-old { Jack Nicklaus } [ Jack Nicklaus ] was \"very disappointing,\" said { Palmer } [ Arnold Palmer ] -- who three-putted 10 times in five days to undermine his fine play from tee to green.But victories in six other { PGA Tour } [ PGA Tour ] events, as well as wiing the { Vardon Trophy } [ Vardon Trophy ] (named after the famous { English } [ England ] golfer { Harry Vardon } [ Harry Vardon ]) for the { U. } [ United States ]S. circuit's low scoring average, rounded off an incredible year.Golf's greatest yearsBy dominating golf as he did that season, Palmer continued a trend started by Vardon in the first year of the 20th century -- following in the footsteps of golf legends such as { Bobby Jones } [ Bobby Jones (golfer) ] and blazing a trail for the likes of { Jack Nicklaus } [ Jack Nicklaus ] and { Tiger Woods } [ Tiger Woods ].Vardon, known as \"Mr. Golf,\" set the ball rolling.Born in the { British } [ United Kingdom ] isle of { Jersey } [ Jersey ], he left an indelible mark on the game by inventing the Vardon Grip -- the overlapping of the small finger over the other when holding a club -- which is used by the majority of the top players in the world today.In { 1900 } [ 1900 World Series of Hockey ] he crossed the { Atlantic } [ Atlantic Ocean ] and became the first player to win both the { U. } [ United States ]S. Open and the { British Open } [ The Open Championship ]. Overall {, } [ Cincinnati Reds ] he captured a record six majors in his homeland. In 1920, at the age of 50 and having suffered from { tuberculosis } [ Tuberculosis ], he still managed second place in the { U. } [ United States ]S. Open -- a true measure of his greatness.Paving the way for professionalsThat decade, another golfing superstar emerged in the form of { Walter Hagen } [ Walter Hagen ], who like { Palmer } [ Arnold Palmer ] helped to popularize the sport with his attacking play and flamboyant lifestyle.The { American } [ United States ] was the first golfer to win $1 million in his career, claiming 11 { major } [ Men's major golf championships ] titles plus five victories at the { Western Open } [ Western Open ] -- which in his era was one of { golf } [ Golf ]'s leading events.In 1924, { Hagen } [ Dietmar Hagen ] was at the peak of his powers and won the { British Open } [ The Open Championship ] as well as the { U. } [ United States ]S. He also won three other { PGA Tour } [ PGA Tour ] events plus the { Belgian Open } [ Belgian Open (golf) ] {. } [ Open de Belgium ]While { Hagen } [ Karl-Heinz Hagen ] helped the acceptance of { professional } [ Professional sports ] players in a sport that had been mainly { amateur } [ Amateur sports ], in 1930 another man became a worldwide name despite refusing to accept a cent for his many triumphs.Father of the MastersWhen the world's elite play at Augusta this week, they owe their participation to the foresight and vision of { Bobby Jones } [ Bobby Jones (golfer) ], who co-designed the course with { Alister MacKenzie } [ Alister MacKenzie ] and co-founded the { Masters Tournament } [ Masters Tournament ] with { Clifford Roberts } [ Clifford Roberts ].S. Opens and two { British } [ United Kingdom ] Opens plus four { U. } [ United Kingdom ]S. Amateur crowns. But his feats of 1930 will surely remain unmatched.He claimed his own { grand slam } [ Grand slam (baseball) ] of the two pro and two unpaid majors on both sides of the Atlantic before promptly retiring at the tender age of 28 to practice law at the { Georgia } [ Georgia (U.S. state) ] { bar } [ Bar (law) ].Lord ByronThe { Second World War } [ World War II ] brought an end to international competition, but that era saw the emergence of one of { Palmer } [ Palmer, Lancashire ]'s heroes -- the great { Byron Nelson } [ Byron Nelson ] {. } [ Byron Nelson ]\"I watched { him } [ George Harrison ] and admired { him } [ George Harrison ] very much.Nelson's greatest year was 1945, near the end of the { war } [ World War II ], when he set a record on the { PGA Tour } [ PGA Tour ] which will surely remain unbroken. His 18 victories out of 35 starts included the { PGA } [ PGA Championship ] championship, and his scoring average of 68.33 stood until it was broken by { Woods } [ Ian Woods ] in 2000.Nelson retired the following year aged 34 to become a { rancher } [ Ranch ] but was the host of a { PGA } [ PGA Tour ] event which bore his name until his death in { 2006 } [ 2006 PGA Tour ].Hogan the heroAs the { U. } [ United States ]S. economy started booming in the { post-war } [ Post-war ] years, { golf } [ Golf ] {'s } [ United States ] profile was further boosted by the exploits of a player who bounced back from life-threatening adversity.Ben { Hogan } [ Ben Hogan ] took determination and will to win to new levels in { 1953 } [ 1953 Ryder Cup ] when he won all three { majors } [ Men's major golf championships ] he was able to contest, and five of six tournaments overall. Badly injured in a car crash in 1949 which nearly claimed his life, { Hogan } [ Larry Hogan ] had to limit his schedule to prevent strain on his body.H won the { Masters } [ Masters Tournament ] by five shots and was six clear in the { U. } [ United States ]S. Open at { Oakmont } [ Oakmont Golf Club ], while he conquered the field at { Carnoustie } [ Carnoustie Golf Links ] in the { British Open } [ The Open Championship ] by four strokes to be the only man under par on the tough { Scottish } [ Scotland ] links.Hogan was unable to play in the { PGA Championships } [ PGA Championship ] because it overlapped the { British Open } [ The Open Championship ], but he would have chosen not to compete because he was unable to cope with the 36 holes per day expected of the players in the { match play } [ Match play ] format.The \"Golden Bear\"A decade after { Palmer } [ Arnold Palmer ] {'s } [ John Palmer ] great year, one of his arch-rivals bestrode the game like a giant.Nicklaus, who had denied { Palmer } [ Jack Palmer ] victory at the { 1962 } [ 1962 U.S. Open (golf) ] { U. } [ United States ]S. Open, was at the peak of his powers.Nicklaus won two { majors } [ Men's major golf championships ] in { 1972 } [ 1972 PGA Tour ], the { Masters } [ 1972 Masters Tournament ] and the { U. } [ 1972 U.S. Open (golf) ]S. Open, and was second to { Lee Trevino } [ Lee Trevino ] at the { British Open } [ The Open Championship ]. Seven victories came on the { PGA Tour } [ PGA Tour ] and, like { Palmer } [ Arnold Palmer ] in '62, he won the money list and the { Vardon Trophy } [ Vardon Trophy ] {. } [ Vardon Trophy ]Nicklaus would eventually set an all-time record of 18 { majors } [ Men's major golf championships ], the final triumph coming at the { Masters } [ Masters Tournament ] in { 1986 } [ 1986 Masters Tournament ] with a famous final-round charge.Champions duelThe \"Golden Bear\" would next be challenged by { Tom Watson } [ Tom Watson (boxer) ] {, } [ Tom Watson (boxer) ] nine years his junior.Watson's win in their famous '\"duel in the sun'\"at { Turnberry } [ Turnberry (golf course) ] in { 1977 } [ 1977 Ryder Cup ] will go down in { golf } [ Golf ] history, but five years later his emergence was complete.Watson denied { Nicklaus } [ Jack Nicklaus ] victory again at the { 1982 } [ 1982 U.S. Open (golf) ] { U. } [ United States ]S. Open at { Pebble Beach } [ Pebble Beach, California ] with a miracle chip from the rough on the short 17th hole. The pair were tied for the lead with { Watson } [ Watson (golfer) ] looking certain to drop a shot when his effort hit the flag and went in for the most unlikely of birdies.It helped seal a two-shot victory, which the { American } [ United States ] followed up by wiing his fourth { British Open } [ The Open Championship ] title at { Troon } [ Troon ] before being named the { PGA Tour } [ PGA Tour ]'s { Player of the Year } [ PGA Tour ] for the fifth of six times overall.Ice-cool EnglishmanThe balance of power in world { golf } [ Golf ] shifted away from the { United States } [ United States ] in the 1990s, with { England } [ England ]'s { Nick Faldo } [ Nick Faldo ] taking over as the No.1 as the { decade } [ Decade ] started.With an attention to detail and competitive edge modeled on Hogan {, } [ Faldo ] Faldo claimed the { Masters } [ Masters Tournament ] for the second time in { 1990 } [ 1990 Masters Tournament ] after a playoff with { Raymond Floyd } [ Raymond Floyd ]. At the home of { golf } [ Golf ] { St. } [ St. Andrews, Missouri ] { Andrews } [ St Andrews ], he dominated the { British Open } [ The Open Championship ] from the start to win by five shots with a record 18-under aggregate.Faldo also finished tied for third, one shot back, in the { U. } [ United States ]S. Open at { Medinah } [ Medinah, Illinois ] and was named golfer of the year on both sides of the Atlantic.Tiger on the prowlHowever, { golf } [ Golf ] had to wait another decade before the astonishing feats of a player who has become one of the most recognizable { athletes } [ Athlete ] on the planet, and certainly one of the richest.Tiger { Woods } [ Tiger Woods ] could manage only fifth place at the { 2000 } [ 2000 PGA Tour ] { Masters } [ Masters Tournament ] at { Augusta } [ Augusta National Golf Club ], but it was to prove just about his only disappointment in a record-breaking year.His 15-stroke victory in the { U. } [ United States ]S Open at { Pebble Beach } [ Pebble Beach, California ] was \"the greatest performance in { golf } [ Golf ] history\" according { Sports Illustrated } [ Sports Illustrated ] magazine. The { American } [ United States ] broke { Faldo } [ Faldo ]'s { British Open } [ The Open Championship ] record with an eight-shot win at { St. } [ St. Andrews ] { Andrews } [ St Andrews ] and made it three { majors } [ Men's major golf championships ] for the year by beating { Bob May } [ Bob May (golfer) ] in a playoff at the { PGA Championship } [ PGA Championship ].Woods won nine of 20 { PGA Tour } [ PGA Tour ] events that year, with the lowest scoring average in history.

The final number of { immigrants } [ Immigration ] shielded will be affected by restrictions such as whether people with { police } [ Police ] infractions such as a { DUI } [ Driving under the influence ] can qualify, they said.The plan would include an expansion of { visas } [ Travel visa ] in certain categories of workers such as those in the { technology } [ Technology ] industry, which is popular with the business community, and more resources to protect the border, according to the sources.The move has been the subject of months of anticipation. But with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on { Capitol Hill } [ Capitol Hill ], the { president } [ President of the United States ]'s advisers could also wait until next month to make a final decision on how to repair a system both { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] and { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] admit needs fixing.And while officials say the specifics of what he will aounce haven't been finalized, the broad outlines of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months.For the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold, the moment is charged.\"Without hesitation I can say the level of anticipation is intense. { We } [ United States ] were hoping this would happen in September,\" said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the { National Council of La Raza } [ National Council of La Raza ] {. } [ United States ] \"It's long overdue. The sooner the better.\"Millions affectedAn expansion of { Obama } [ Barack Obama ]'s \"deferred action\" program ( {DACA } [ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ]) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered to be a likely component of { Obama } [ Barack Obama ]'s immigration action, according to two sources close to the plan who spoke to { CNN } [ CNN ]. DACA delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the { United States } [ United States ] by their parents as children.In the { DACA } [ Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ] plan there were caveats on who was eligible. In order to apply, { immigrants } [ Immigration ] needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted, and younger than 16 when they were brought to the { United States } [ United States ]. And applicants are required to either be in { school } [ School ], have earned a { high school } [ Secondary school ] degree or be honorably discharged { veterans } [ Veteran ].The { Migration Policy Institute } [ Migration Policy Institute ], a { nonpartisan } [ Nonpartisanism ] { think tank } [ Think tank ], says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation, with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade.But many more would become eligible if { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] expands, or eliminates altogether, those requirements, which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the { DREAM Act } [ DREAM Act ], which has languished in { Congress } [ United States Congress ] {. } [ United States Congress ]The sources said that some parents of { U. } [ United States ]S. citizens and legal permanent residents, or so-called \"green-card holders,\" would be granted legal status that allows them to work and avoid deportation. The { President } [ President of the United States ]'s plan would affect those parents who have been in the { United States } [ United States ] five years. That move would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks, according to a { Migration Policy Institute } [ Migration Policy Institute ] analysis.According to the two sources who spoke to { CNN } [ CNN ], any executive action is not expected to include broader use of so-called \"parole\" status. While some pro-immigration advocates support this idea, it is seen as a red line by many { conservatives } [ Conservatism in the United States ] who view it as a potential way to provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are parents of { U. } [ United States ]S. citizens. Currently such { parole } [ Parole ] status is provided to spouses and family members of people serving in the { U. } [ United States ]S. military. If the parents of children who are eligible under the current { DACA } [ Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ] rules were included, the number would rise to 3.7 million.Changing those rules could also expand the eligible population: eliminating the education requirement, for example, would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation, the { Migration Policy Institute } [ Migration Policy Institute ] estimates.And allowing people over 30 who were brought to the { United States } [ United States ] by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 { immigrants } [ Immigration ] to apply, the { think-tank } [ Think tank ]'s report says.Immigration activists, frustrated with the rate of deportations under { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] and further exasperated with the delay in { Obama } [ Barack Obama ]'s immigration action, have been urging the { White House } [ White House ] to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allows the maximum number of people to stay.But many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual aouncement will fall short of those appeals.Political footballWhatever { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] finally decides -- and at this point, the options seem clear -- he'll be met with fierce blowback from { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] on { Capitol Hill } [ Capitol Hill ], who have spent months preparing for the aouncement by warning of executive overreach and political well-poisoning.The { White House } [ White House ] yielded to politics once already, delaying the { immigration } [ Immigration ] aouncement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year. The move was meant to shield vulnerable { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] from political attacks on the topic; many of them lost their races anyway.The postponement wasn't met kindly from { immigration } [ Immigration ] groups, who said there wasn't time to spare on providing { deportation } [ Deportation ] relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules.There could still be { election year } [ Elections in the United States ] ramifications, since { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] { Sen. } [ United States Senate ] Mary { Landrieu } [ Mary Landrieu ] remains locked in a { runoff } [ Two-round system ] contest with a { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] rival. But with the { Senate } [ United States Senate ] firmly in { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] hands, any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among { immigration reform } [ Immigration reform ] activists.\"For us, every day that there's a delay, and every day that people have to wait, means more people unjustly deported,\" said Praeli.Some { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] want { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] to wait to aounce the executive action after essential business clears the { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] and { Senate } [ United States Senate ]. Sen. { Harry Reid } [ Harry Reid ], the outgoing { Senate Majority Leader } [ Party leaders of the United States Senate ], told { CNN } [ CNN ] the { president } [ President of the United States ] should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved. He said enacting the { immigration } [ Immigration ] plan ahead of the spending measure could anger { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] and risk a government shutdown.\"I'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it.But no matter when the action comes, it seems destined to ignite { GOP } [ Republican Party (United States) ] furor. Joe Barton, said if { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] goes forward with the plan, { impeachment } [ Impeachment ] proceedings could be a possibility.Those threats aren't exactly a new thing. Democrats have raised millions of dollars by warning their party's base about { impeachment } [ Impeachment in the United States ] threats from { conservative } [ Conservatism in the United States ] { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] members.More real is the threat that taking { executive } [ Executive (government) ] action on { immigration } [ Immigration ] forestalls any { legislative } [ Legislature ] effort on the matter. { GOP } [ Republican Party (United States) ] leaders on { Capitol Hill } [ Capitol Hill ] say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ], leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system.Obama seems little concerned by { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] threats against making the immigration move, however, pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] but balked.\"I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse,\" he said during last week's news conference.'."}, {"cnn/training/599346c8c7b80799c99121920e6d4ec3366d5958": "People visit { Jerusalem } [ Jerusalem ] for the rich { history } [ History ], interwoven { religious } [ Religion ] narratives and crumbling holy walls.

But they differ sharply on both the nature and timetable of the cuts.Despite the strong { partisan } [ Partisan (politics) ] rhetoric {, } [ Republican Party (United States) ] there have been signs of a growing recognition of a need for further { compromise } [ Compromise ] {. } [ Republican Party (United States) ]Sources close to the negotiations have also told { CNN } [ CNN ] that { Vice President } [ Vice President of the United States ] { Joe Biden } [ Joe Biden ] is very much in the mix of back-chael conversations on a possible fallback position.White House Chief of Staff { Bill Daley } [ Bill Daley ] told { CNN } [ CNN ] Thursday that, presuming the Boehner plan wins House approval and gets blocked in the Senate, the next step is for everyone \"to take a step back in the { Congress } [ United States Congress ] and look at where is a point of compromise.\" {Daley } [ John J. Daley ] said that similarities between the { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] and { Reid } [ Barry Reid ] plans \"may be the grounds for a deal that, hopefully, both parties can pass.\"Both plans suffered setbacks earlier this week when the { nonpartisan } [ Nonpartisanism ] { Congressional Budget Office } [ Congressional Budget Office ] released reports concluding that they fell short of their stated deficit reduction goals.Boehner's plan, which has since been revised, proposed generating a total of $917 { billion } [ 1,000,000,000 ] in savings while initially raising the debt ceiling by $900 { billion } [ 1,000,000,000 ]. The speaker has pledged to match any debt ceiling hike with dollar-for-dollar spending cuts.His plan, however, would require a second vote by { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to raise the { debt ceiling } [ United States debt ceiling ] by a combined $2.5 { trillion } [ Orders of magnitude (numbers) ] -- enough to last through the end of 2012. It would create a special { congressional } [ United States Congress ] { committee } [ United States congressional committee ] to recommend additional savings of $1.6 { trillion } [ Orders of magnitude (numbers) ] or more.Any failure on the part of { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to enact mandated spending reductions or abide by new spending caps would trigger automatic across-the-board budget cuts.The plan, as amended Friday, also calls for { congressional } [ United States Congress ] passage of a { balanced budget } [ Balanced budget ] amendment to the { Constitution } [ Constitution of the United States ] before the second vote to raise the { debt ceiling } [ United States debt ceiling ], which would likely be required at some point during the winter.As for { Reid } [ Reid (electoral district) ]'s plan, a revised version he proposed Friday would reduce { deficits } [ Government budget balance ] over the next decade by $2.4 trillion and raise the debt ceiling by a similar amount. It includes $1 { trillion } [ Orders of magnitude (numbers) ] in savings based on the plaed { U. } [ United States ]S. withdrawals from military engagements in { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] and { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {. } [ United States Department of Defense ]Reid's plan also would establish a { congressional committee } [ United States congressional committee ] made up of 12 { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] and { Senate } [ United States Senate ] members to consider additional options for debt reduction. The { committee } [ Committee ]'s proposals would be guaranteed by a { Senate } [ United States Senate ] vote with no { amendments } [ Constitutional amendment ] by the end of the year.In addition, it incorporates a process based on proposal by McCoell that would give { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] the authority to raise the { debt ceiling } [ United States debt ceiling ] in two steps while providing { Congress } [ United States Congress ] the opportunity to vote its disapproval.Among other things {, } [ Texas ] Reid has stressed that his plan meets the key { GOP } [ Republican Party (United States) ] demand for no additional { taxes } [ Tax ] {. } [ Tax ] { Boehner } [ John Boehner ], however, argued this week that { Reid } [ Reid (New York politician) ]'s plan fails to tackle popular entitlement programs such as { Medicare } [ Medicare (United States) ], which are among the biggest drivers of the debt.A recent { CNN/ORC International } [ CNN/ORC International ] Poll reveals a growing public exasperation and demand for compromise. Sixty-four percent of respondents to a July 18-20 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Only 34% preferred a debt reduction plan based solely on spending reductions.According to the poll, the public is sharply divided along partisan lines; { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] and { independents } [ Independent politician ] are open to a number of different approaches because they think a failure to raise the { debt ceiling } [ United States debt ceiling ] would cause a major crisis for the country. Republicans, however, draw the line at tax increases, and a narrow majority of them oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances.CNN's { Ted Barrett } [ Ted Barrett ], Kate Bolduan, { Gloria Borger } [ Gloria Borger ], { Keating Holland } [ Keating Holland ], Briaa Keilar, Jeae Sahadi, Xuan Thai, Jessica Yellin, { Barbara Starr } [ Barbara Starr ] and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report'."}, {"cnn/training/13899572286722dd8f6d90ca698eee43744c6e74": "President { Barack Obama } [ Barack Obama ] didn't know the { United States } [ United States ] was collecting communications of allied leaders such as { German } [ Germany ] Chancellor { Angela Merkel } [ Angela Merkel ], the chairman of the { Senate Intelligence Committee } [ United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ] said on Monday.Moreover, Sen. { Diae Feinstein } [ Diae Feinstein ] of { California } [ California ] said in a statement that her panel was unaware of the sweeping intelligence effort and said that the { White House } [ White House ] had told her that such data collection \"will not continue.\" {Feinstein } [ Dianne Feinstein ]'s overall comments confirmed recent news reports on the { National Security Agency } [ National Security Agency ] electronic surveillance network revealed in classified leaks by former agency Agency contractor { Edward Snowden } [ Edward Snowden ] {. } [ Edward Snowden ]Separately, { Director of National Intelligence } [ Director of National Intelligence ] { James Clapper } [ James Clapper ] said late Monday that he was authorizing the release of more details about the government's collection of telephone records under the { Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act } [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ], in an effort to show the extent the spying program was overseen by a secret federal court and { Congress } [ United States Congress ].Clapper testifies on Tuesday before the { House Select Intelligence Committee } [ United States House Select Committee on Intelligence ] about the program.The documents date mostly to 2009, when the { administration } [ Presidency of Barack Obama ] was pushing lawmakers to reauthorize sections of the { Patriot Act } [ Patriot Act ] that were set to expire.House committee to question spy chiefs about phone tapping allegationsOne document from 2011 notifies the House and { Senate } [ United States Senate Committee on Armed Services ] intelligence and judiciary committees of the { NSA } [ National Security Agency ]'s testing in 2010-2011 of a program to collect cell phone tower data that could track mobile phone users.

The state of SuperiorConcern over a perceived lack of interest from the { Michigan } [ Michigan ] state government, the people of the { Upper Peninsula } [ Upper Peninsula of Michigan ] (U.P.), affectionately known as \"Yoopers,\" have been trying to secede and form the State of Superior since as far back as 1897.The movement gained momentum after 1957 when a { bridge } [ Bridge ] coecting the { U. } [ United States ]P. region to { Lower Michigan } [ Lower Michigan ] made it easier for southern \"Trolls\" (people who live \"below the bridge\") and Yoopers to mingle. This animosity continued into the mid-1980s, when 20,000 signatures were collected and submitted to the { state } [ U.S. state ] for a { secession } [ Secession ] request.However, the number was shy of the 36,000 required, and the request subsequently denied. The { secessionist } [ Secession ] drive lives on today, as numerous { grassroots } [ Grassroots ] organizations are trying to muster support for another official attempt at an independent { U. } [ United States ]P. Until that day comes, though, the Yoopers and Trolls will just have to try to get along.3. The Great Republic of Rough and ReadyRough and Ready {, California } [ Rough and Ready, California ], was a mining town founded in 1849 by the Rough and Ready Company of { Wisconsin } [ Wisconsin ] {. } [ Rough and Ready, California ] As the town's population rapidly exploded to 3,000, lawlessness was on the rise -- and the U.S. government was not much help squelching the rampant crime. Mental Floss: Three controversial mapsAdditionally, a new { federal } [ Federal government of the United States ] tax on { mining } [ Mining ] operations added fuel to the region's civil unrest. Seeing little support from { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ], on April 7, 1850, the townspeople voted to secede from the { Union } [ Union (American Civil War) ].But just three months later, as the { Fourth of July } [ Independence Day (United States) ] approached, The Great Republic of Rough and Ready wanted to have a celebration (which seems odd considering they were no longer technically { Americans } [ United States ]). The townspeople voted themselves back into the { Union } [ Union (American Civil War) ] on the very same day and the party went off as plaed.4. The Conch RepublicIn the early-1980s, the U.S. Border Patrol set up a { checkpoint } [ Border checkpoint ] at the entrance to the { Florida Keys } [ Florida Keys ] in an effort to stop illegal drugs and { immigrants } [ Immigration ]. The time to check everyone's identification at the checkpoint resulted in a 20-mile traffic jam that turned { tourists } [ Tourism ] away, thus damaging the economy in the Keys.After numerous legal attempts to have the checkpoint removed, on April 23, 1982, { Key West } [ Key West ] mayor { Deis Wardlow } [ Deis Wardlow ] declared the { Florida Keys } [ Florida Keys ] were seceding from the { Union } [ United States ].Moments later, now-Prime Minister { Wardlow } [ William Wardlow ] symbolically declared war on the { U. } [ United States ]S. by breaking a stale piece of { Cuban } [ Cuba ] bread over the head of a man dressed in a { U. } [ United States ]S. Navy uniform. One minute later, { Wardlow } [ Edward Wardlow ] turned to the { Admiral } [ Admiral ] in charge of the { U. } [ United States ]S. Naval Base at { Key West } [ Key West ] and surrendered, thus ending the { Conch Republic } [ Conch Republic ]'s Civil Rebellion. He then immediately asked for $1 billion in { federal } [ Federal government of the United States ] aid to help rebuild his war-torn nation's economy.While officially the { Republic } [ Republic ] only existed for one minute, the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the rebellion lives on. Today you can buy Conch Republic citizen and diplomatic passports (both of which have been used for international travel, though they are not intended to be official documents) and even an official flag of the republic (complete with the awesome motto, \"We seceded where others failed\"). The community has even minted a series of limited edition one-conch dollar coins that can be used as legal tender while in the Keys.5. The State of AbsarokaFeeling that the { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] southern half of { Wyoming } [ Wyoming ] was not working in conjunction with the rest of the state, a secessionist movement was launched by northern { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] in 1939 to create a new state that would better serve its more conservative population.This state, Absaroka -- so named after the nearby mountain range -- was to be made up of northern { Wyoming } [ Wyoming ], southeast { Montana } [ Montana ], and the western region of { South Dakota } [ South Dakota ]. While the { secessionist } [ Secession ] movement was never very large or pursued through legal chaels, that didn't stop A. R. { Swickard } [ William Swickard ], the street commissioner of { Sheridan } [ Sheridan, Wyoming ], { Wyoming } [ Wyoming ], from appointing himself { governor } [ Governor ] of the \"state.\"The movement went so far as to press { Absaroka } [ Absaroka ] license plates and crown a Miss { Absaroka } [ Absaroka ] beauty queen. { Absaroka } [ Absaroka ] could even brag about a visit from a foreign dignitary, King { Haakon VII } [ Haakon VII of Norway ] of { Norway } [ Norway ] (though he was officially visiting { Wyoming } [ Wyoming ] and just happened to be in { Absaroka } [ Absaroka ]).Despite all of the hoopla, the { state } [ U.S. state ] never came to be, and now, so many years later, the intent of the { secessionist } [ Secession ] movement is in question. Some believe there was a genuine attempt to create a new { state } [ State (polity) ], while others say it was just a fun way for { cowboys } [ Cowboy ] to distract themselves during tough economic times.6. The State of JeffersonNorthern { California } [ California ] and southern { Oregon } [ Oregon ] have been trying to merge since 1852. The attempts have been met with mixed results, though the \"State of Jefferson\" movement of 1941 came closest to making it happen.The region felt it was being ignored by their respective { state legislatures } [ State legislature (United States) ], so in response the people created the \"State of Jefferson Citizen's Committee\" to explore the possibilities of { secession } [ Secession ]. The group began stopping cars on { Highway 99 } [ Washington State Route 99 ] to hand out the state's \"Proclamation of Independence,\" a pamphlet outlining the grievances they held and the solutions they proposed.To help rally their cause, they developed a state flag made up of a gold miner's pan with two black X's inside, representing the double-cross they felt the { Oregon } [ Oregon ] and { California } [ California ] state governments had pulled. Mental Floss: Thomas { Jefferson } [ Jefferson, California ]On December 4, 1941, Judge { John Childs } [ John Childs (American politician) ] was elected governor of { Jefferson } [ Jefferson, California ] in the state's temporary capital of { Yreka } [ Yreka, California ], { California } [ California ]. The event was filmed by numerous { newsreel } [ Newsreel ] companies who were set to air the footage during the week of December 8.History had other plans, as the { Japanese } [ Japan ] bombed { Pearl Harbor } [ Pearl Harbor ] the day before the big premiere. Driven by a sense of national obligation, the { Jefferson } [ Thomas Jefferson ] { secession } [ Secession ] was put aside and never really regained momentum. While the official movement might have died out, the residents of this region still hold the concept in their hearts, with many identifying themselves even today as the population of the great state of { Jefferson } [ Jefferson, West Virginia ].7. The McDonald TerritoryNoel, Missouri, located in { McDonald County } [ McDonald County, Missouri ] in the far southwest corner of the Show Me State, has been a popular tourist destination for many years. Therefore, when the { Missouri State Highway Commission } [ Missouri Department of Transportation ] left { Noel } [ Noel, Missouri ] off their aual \"Family Vacationland\" map in 1961, the region was not happy pleased.To display their dissatisfaction, { McDonald County } [ McDonald County, Texas ] drew up papers of { secession } [ Secession ] and presented them to the { state legislature } [ Texas Legislature ], declaring itself the independent McDonald Territory. The { county } [ County (United States) ] went so far as to elect officials, form a territorial { militia } [ Militia ], and even printed up { visas } [ Travel visa ] that were issued to visitors so they could travel throughout the territory.Perhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of McDonald Territory stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area. While most agree that the { secession } [ Secession ] was done purely for { publicity } [ Publicity ], the state of { Missouri } [ Missouri ] wasn't necessarily happy about the type of { publicity } [ Publicity ] it was garnering.So in order to end this mock rebellion, the { state } [ U.S. state ] declared that { state } [ U.S. state ] employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for { McDonald County } [ McDonald County, Texas ], all current { state } [ U.S. state ] employees would be fired, and all { state } [ U.S. state ] funding would be withheld.And here's one more { secessionist } [ Secession ] movement that's been in the news this year.

The bitterness dates back to 1958, when { Alaska } [ Alaska ] {'s } [ Alaska ] citizens were given a simple yes-or-no vote on { statehood } [ U.S. state ] {. } [ Alaska ]Many { Alaskans } [ Alaska ] felt they were denied more options on the issue, prompting a land developer named Joe Vogler to organize a re-vote that would offer { Alaskans } [ Alaska ] four possibilities -- remain a territory, become a { state } [ U.S. state ], take { commonwealth } [ Commonwealth (U.S. insular area) ] status, or become a separate { nation } [ Nation ].Using the vote as his { platform } [ Party platform ], { Vogler } [ Paul Vogler ] ran for { governor } [ Governor ] in { 1974 } [ 1974 Minnesota gubernatorial election ] -- and soon made a habit of it. With colorful slogans such as, \"I'm an { Alaskan } [ Alaska ], not an { American } [ United States ]. I've got no use for { America } [ United States ] or her damned institutions,\" { Vogler } [ Paul Vogler ] spearheaded the { Alaskan Independence Party } [ Alaskan Independence Party ] ( {AIP } [ Alaskan Independence Party ]), and his campaign has twice topped 5 percent of the vote.  Mental Floss: Nine modern-day independence movementsMore surprisingly, former { U. } [ United States ]S. interior secretary { Wally Hickel } [ Wally Hickel ] got elected governor on the { AIP } [ Alliance for Israel Party ] ticket in 1990. Unfortunately for the party, Hickel only ran on the ticket because he lost the { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] primary. Never a supporter of the { plebiscite } [ Referendum ] idea, Hickel left the { AIP } [ Alliance of Independent Progressives ] and rejoined the { Republicans } [ Republican Party (Germany) ] in 1994.Today, the AIP continues to draw about 4 percent of voters statewide. And in 2006, { Alaska } [ Alaska ] took part in the first-ever North American Secessionist Convention, joining other groups from { Vermont } [ Vermont ], { Hawaii } [ Hawaii ], and the { South } [ Southern United States ].

And that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one-third of those fighters are from the regular army.A { CNN } [ CNN ] team that's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia, notably { Hadi al Ameri } [ Hadi al Ameri ], leader of the { Badr Organization } [ Badr Organization ]. Iranian military advisers are on hand, and highly influential on the battlefield.As { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands, it might seem odd that the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army is unable to take them on alone. After all, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) received $20 billion of { U. } [ United States ]S. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment, bases and training.So just why are the { ISF } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] incapable of reclaiming territory seized by { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]? And how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet? The answers go back to the { U. } [ United States ]S. { invasion of Iraq } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ] in 2003; { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {'s } [ Iraq ] military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade.One of the most controversial acts of the { U. } [ United States ]S.-led { Coalition Provisional Authority } [ Coalition Provisional Authority ], which ran { Iraq } [ Iraq ] following the ouster of { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ], was to disband the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army. The decision, taken in May 2003, \"immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the { U. } [ United States ]S. { occupiers } [ Occupation (proprietary company) ],\" as { James P. } [ James P. ] Pfiffner put it in 2010.President { George W. } [ George W. Bush ] Bush told his biographer { Robert Draper } [ Robert Draper ] in 2006: \"The policy had been to keep the [Iraqi] army intact; didn't happen. } [ Iraq ]\" The reasons have been disputed ever since.In some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers; at the same time training of { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing { insurgency } [ Insurgency ]. In 2004, as in 2014, the security forces buckled as a { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] insurgency spread through northern and western { Iraq } [ Iraq ] {. } [ Iraq ]Billions of dollars were spent creating a new { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army from scratch. But it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions, so unofficial sectarian { militia } [ Militia ] filled the vacuum -- { militia } [ Militia ] that never quite went away.Over a seven-year period, more than $4 billion was spent on renovating and building { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] bases. Logistical and maintenance support: $2.6 billion. Supply of equipment: $3.4 billion (in addition to what the { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] bought themselves.) Training and staffing the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] police: a cool $9.4 billion.With { U. } [ United States ]S. assistance and the \"Sons of Iraq\" program to coax { Sui } [ Sui family ] tribes into fighting { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] in { Iraq } [ Iraq ], violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010. But once { U. } [ United States ]S. forces left at the end of 2011, and with them intelligence-gathering and training programs, things began to unravel.By then, the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty. The only effective units were { special forces } [ Special forces ] such as the { Golden Division } [ Golden Division ] {. } [ Golden Division ] Sophisticated { U. } [ United States ]S. equipment, such as { M-1 Abrams } [ M-1 Abrams ] battle tanks, was not maintained. { Corruption } [ Political corruption ] was rife -- and { political } [ Politics ] interference in the { military } [ Military ] grew exponentially.As then Prime Minister { Nouri al-Maliki } [ Nouri al-Maliki ] tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013, the high command of the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] military became a political football -- with loyalty to { al-Maliki } [ Nouri al-Maliki ] prized above competence. He bypassed the { defense } [ Defence ministry ] and { interior } [ Interior ministry ] ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies.The { Institute for the Study of War } [ Institute for the Study of War ] reported in 2013, \"the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-Maliki to choose his preferred officers (nearly all { Shia } [ Shia Islam ]) to head the most significant command positions in { Iraq } [ Iraq ].\" { Al-Maliki } [ Al-Maliki ] also began integrating { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] { militia } [ Militia ] into army units.At the same time, the phenomenon of \"ghost soldiers\" went unchecked -- men who were either dead or { AWOL } [ Desertion ] but whose wages were still being paid, often to corrupt commanders. So the { army } [ Army ], in numbers, looked much stronger than it was. In fact, by the time { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] rolled south, the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000.Nearly half the army -- four { divisions } [ Division (military) ] -- collapsed in short order as { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] fighters stormed south from { Syria } [ Syria ] in the early summer of 2014. { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] used speed, discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army didn't have. It had also cultivated allies among members of { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] tribes ready to act as a { fifth column } [ Fifth column ], and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee.The desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] shrines in { Samarra } [ Samarra ] prompted a rapid mobilization of { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the { Badr Organization } [ Badr Organization ] and the { Asaib Ahl al-Haq } [ Asaib Ahl al-Haq ]. Some members of these { militia } [ Militia ] had gained combat experience fighting for the { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] regime in { Syria } [ Syria ] {. } [ Syria ]In June, the most respected religious authority among { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] Shi'ites, Grand Ayatollah { Ali al-Sistani } [ Ali al-Sistani ], appealed to { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] to mobilize against the enemy.  The call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of { Shia } [ Shia Islam ], determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ]'s { Baathist } [ Ba'ath Party ] regime.The militia -- called al Hashed al Shabi or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) -- were trained, equipped and most importantly led by { Iranian } [ Iran ] military advisers and quickly became battle hardened. What they lacked in { military } [ Military ] skills, they made up for in determination.The { Iranians } [ Iran ] have invested heavily in the { PMUs } [ Pressurized heavy-lift vehicle ]. The commander of { Iran } [ Iran ]'s Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, seems to have spent more time in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] than { Iran } [ Iran ] since last summer and has been photographed around { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ]. According to several analysts, it is { Suleimani } [ Abdul Rashid Suleimani ] that has been organizing and directing the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better plaed assault than previous operations.Christopher Harmer of the { Institute for the Study of War } [ Institute for the Study of War ] says the role of both the { Iranians } [ Iran ] and the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the { ISF } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]. And he says that \"if the { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ] operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] government's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the { Iranians } [ Iran ] and the { PMU } [ Popular Mobilization Union ] are going to demand payback.\"The role of { Suleimani } [ Nasrallah Boutesem ] and al Quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ]'s view -- means that { US } [ United States ] airpower has not been made available.\"The { U. } [ United States ]S.\"The { chairman } [ Chairperson ] of the { U. } [ United States ]S. { Joint Chiefs of Staff } [ Joint Chiefs of Staff ] {, } [ Joint Chiefs of Staff ] Gen. Martin Dempsey, alluded to the dilemma when in { Baghdad } [ Baghdad ] on Monday.\"What I'm trying to sort out, actually, is the degree to which their near-term embrace of the assistance they're receiving from { Iran } [ Iran ] is a reaction to the existential threat [posed by } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]], or whether it is something longer-term,\" he said.Soon after taking office, { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Iraq ] { Haider al Abadi } [ Haider al Abadi ] fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement.xe2x80xafAt the time a statement on his website stressed \"the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels.\"xe2x80xafU.S.-led efforts to train a new { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] army designed to defeat { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] are well underway. The aim is to stand up 12 { brigades } [ Brigade ] each of about 5,000 troops -- including three { brigades } [ Brigade ] of { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] { peshmerga } [ Peshmerga ] {. } [ Peshmerga ]But as { Harmer } [ John Harmer ] notes, \"the Iraqi Security Forces are yet to go head-to-head with { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and win without help from the PMUs. { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] is demonstrably more capable than the { ISF } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] {. } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ]\"Clearing { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] from well-entrenched defenses around { Mosul } [ Mosul ], { Iraq } [ Iraq ]'s second largest city, seems well beyond the army's capability. In November, Gen. Dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city.That's problematic for several reasons. Kurdish officials told { CNN } [ CNN ] last month that the longer the battle for { Mosul } [ Mosul ] is delayed, the tougher it will be. They claim that they caot maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely.The { Iraqi } [ Iraq ] government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there. But above all, the need for { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] cities is fraught with peril.Human Rights Watch has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] communities by the militia. { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ] is an especially sensitive area: in June last year, { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority { Shia } [ Shia Islam ], at Camp Speicher. Some families of the murdered recruits, and a few survivors, have claimed local { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] tribes may have helped { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage.HRW { Middle East } [ Middle East ] Deputy Director { Joe Stork } [ Joe Stork ] says that \"past fighting raises grave concerns that { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ]'s civilians are at serious risk from both { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter.\" { Tit-for-tat } [ Tit-for-tat ] atrocities are fuelled by a stream of { social media } [ Social media ] videos showing abuses committed by all sides.ISIS' use of children: Propaganda and military trainingDuring the { Tikrit } [ Tikrit ] operation, both Prime Minister al Abadi and { Hadi al Ameri } [ Hadi al Ameri ] of the { Badr Organization } [ Badr Organization ] have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected. Only when the { city } [ City ] is taken {, } [ Jerusalem ] will we know whether their { appeals } [ Appeal ] were heeded {. } [ Jerusalem ]Harmer says he believes a majority of { Iraqis } [ Iraq ] want to see their country survive; far fewer want a return to { sectarian } [ Sectarianism ] conflict akin to { civil war } [ Civil war ]. But it remains a possibility.One of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the { Shiite } [ Shia Islam ] militia and { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] tribal brigades into the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than have them operate as independent armies. They are meant to constitute a new { National Guard } [ United States National Guard ] {, } [ National Guard (United States) ] but the mechanics and timing remain problematic.The leaders of these { militia } [ Militia ] have tasted power; their men have shed blood. They are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when { ISIS } [ Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ] are beaten. And they won't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come.CNN's { Ben Wedeman } [ Ben Wedeman ] and { Kareem Khadder } [ Kareem Khadder ] contributed to this story.'."}, {"cnn/training/ea509348179f92b6dd5244fcd7392221d6114042": "(CNN) -- There's more to { Election Day } [ Election Day (United States) ] than just the { presidential } [ President of the United States ] campaign.

For a more detailed defense of the legitimacy of this political perspective, { David Brooks } [ David Brooks (commentator) ] gave a typically eloquent explanation of the { centrist } [ Centrism ] political leader as a craftsman in a must-read column.The 10 standout centrist candidates on this list are { independents } [ Independent politician ], { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] and { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] who all recognize that hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face.That's why we need them in the next { Congress } [ United States Congress ] -- to break the fever of division and dysfunction, define the common ground that exists on the urgent issues we face and then build on them.

But he says they also led to an overreaction that continues today.Zakaria argues the organization behind the attacks, { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ], has been greatly diminished by the { U. } [ United States ]S. response to { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] and by growing opposition to the group in the { Muslim } [ Islam ] world:\"All these trends have worked to further diminish the threat { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] poses to us. { We } [ United States ]'re in a strange situation where the { right } [ Right-wing politics ] doesn't want to acknowledge it because it would suggest { we } [ United States ] don't need to be in quite this much of a { war } [ War ] footing and . the { left } [ Left-wing politics ] seems reluctant to accept some of this because it suggests that, { God } [ God ] forbid, { George W. } [ George W. ] Bush might have done something right.\"As a result of our political dysfunction, we have lost the ability to have a rational conversation about { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] {,\" } [ 9/11 ] { Zakaria } [ Zakaria ] said.The author and host of { CNN } [ CNN ]'s \" {Fareed Zakaria GPS } [ Fareed Zakaria GPS ] {\" } [ Fareed Zakaria GPS ] spoke to { CNN } [ CNN ] on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: {CNN } [ CNN ]: Is the { U. } [ United States ]S. safer today than before { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ]? {Fareed Zakaria } [ Fareed Zakaria ]: There's no question we're safer. Look, { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] changed the way in which we viewed the problem of { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] and { Islamic } [ Islam ] radicalism, and we've gotten attentive to both. First of all, there have been huge measures taken -- a series of very simple, sensible measures that decrease the likelihood of anything like { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] happening.Sealing the { cockpit } [ Cockpit ] door, by itself, means that a { plane } [ Airplane ] can never be used as a { missile } [ Missile ] and things like that . the { security } [ Security ] measures have made it much more difficult for high-value targets to be vulnerable in quite the way they were.The second part is that we have gone after these { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and associated groups quite vigorously, chasing them around the mountains of { Afghanistan } [ Afghanistan ] of course but also tracking their money. And those things collectively have made a big difference, and there's no question in my mind, we're safer.Now we can begin to ask ourselves whether we have overdone the countermeasures, whether the tens of billions of dollars that have been added year after year to the intelligence budget, to the Homeland Security budget have been all necessary or are we on a kind of autopilot where no request for homeland security can ever be denied, and it has become part of the gargantuan pork barrel projects in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ]. We didn't spend a lot of time in the year after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ] -- once we had taken it on, once we had started chasing these people around the world, measures which I strongly supported then and still strongly support -- whether that had been effective and whether we had broken up the organization and made it far more difficult for them to operate. And therefore, what was the real nature of the threat going forward?I think it's clear that { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] is a much-diminished force. It has the power to inspire a series of local organizations around the world, but it has very little power to direct these high-profile terrorist attacks itself. The reaction to my point that { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] is weaker than we think has surprised me only because I've made this point since 2004, and I've made it repeatedly.CNN: Why do you think many people have not agreed with that point?Zakaria: I do think we have a tendency in the { United States } [ United States ] to underestimate the evil intentions of our enemies, but overestimate their capacity, their capabilities.What we now know, based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and '80s, the U.S. was massively overestimating the military capacity of the { Soviet Union } [ Soviet Union ] {. } [ Soviet Union ]CNN: In what way?Zakaria: If you look at every measure, from bombers to missiles, on almost every count, we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize, their capacity to build up, and as a result we had created a much, much larger { military-industrial complex } [ Military\u2013industrial complex ] than would have been necessary to combat the actual { Soviet } [ Soviet Union ] threat rather than the one we perceived.Similarly with { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ], the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring { nuclear } [ Nuclear weapon ], { biological } [ Biological agent ] and { chemical } [ Chemical weapon ] weapons, which proved to be largely untrue.When we look at { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ], we have to ask ourselves: What is their actual capacity to inflict harm?The second sense in which I mean it is I do think there is a tendency within the { American } [ United States ] appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security. { Nobody } [ Nobody ] wants to deny the request for more { security } [ Security ], more measures, more procedures, all of which come with more { budgets } [ Budget ], more { bureaucrats } [ Bureaucrat ] .CNN: So what should be done now?Zakaria: This would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves, in order to combat the actual threat that { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] poses, which is real but which is limited in some senses -- what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need, what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating, reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer.It's almost as though we took the entire { Cold War } [ Cold War ] bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats, we just layered on top of the mountains of { Cold War } [ Cold War ] bureaucracy another set of mountains of { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] bureaucracy, never mind that the { Cold War } [ Cold War ] is over .This is not a way to run a serious { national security } [ National security ] policy. And the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the { Cold War } [ Cold War ], unlike { World War II } [ World War II ], this is not a war that has a clean ending, so you caot set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus.This is a kind of existential reality that the { United States } [ United States ] has to deal with, the possibility of { terrorism } [ Terrorism ], the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society, so we've got to ask ourselves is this the normal { national security } [ National security ] state we want to live with.CNN: Was the concept of a \"war on terror\" mistaken?Zakaria: I don't know if I would quibble with it that much. The problem of course is that { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] is a { tactic } [ Military tactics ], you can't declare { war } [ War ] against a { tactic } [ Military tactics ]. But in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world, we needed to track their money. { I } [ I (1996 film) ] have no problem with any of that . the problem is you can fight a { war } [ War ] but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent, and if you think he's 25 feet tall vs. five feet tall, that's important. { That } [ That ]'s a huge { misdiagnosis } [ Medical error ] of the { problem } [ Problem solving ] .CNN: Why do you think people have missed the change in { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ]'s capabilities?Zakaria: We're not looking at trends within the { Islamic } [ Islam ] world where { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] has been politically discredited, trends that are taking place within the jihadi community, where prominent jihadis have broken with { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ].The reality is that { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] has been unable to organize a single attack [against a major target in recent years], the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals, further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing al Qaeda and its associated groups. } [ Al-Qaeda ]CNN: Nine years after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ], why is the debate about { Islam } [ Islam ] and { terrorism } [ Terrorism ] fiercer than it's ever been?Zakaria: What's more strange is that it feels as though it's a debate that's taking place without the intervening nine years. Sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002, without noticing all these trends that I've been describing.9/11 was a wake-up call for { America } [ United States ], but it also was a wake-up call for a lot of people in the { Muslim } [ Islam ] world. In the early months after { 9/11 } [ September 11 attacks ], and I wrote about this at the time, there was a sense in the { Muslim } [ Islam ] world that while they might not have approved of the attacks, they understood the { anti-Americanism } [ Anti-Americanism ] that lay behind it. That kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for { Islamic } [ Islam ] radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years.CNN: Why has radicalism lost support?Zakaria: People who felt that way in { Indonesia } [ Indonesia ], in { Jordan } [ Jordan ], even in { Palestine } [ State of Palestine ] have realized that these guys [al Qaeda] are as opposed to the secular regimes of } [ Indonesia ] { Indonesia } [ Indonesia ], { Jordan } [ Jordan ] and in the { Palestinian Authority } [ Palestinian National Authority ] as they are to the { United States } [ United States ] and when they attack { Indonesia } [ Indonesia ] and { Jordan } [ Jordan ], they kill iocent Indonesians and Jordanians, iocent { Muslims } [ Muslims ] by the way.That reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about { Islamic } [ Islam ] extremism that has been very important. I should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there's no question, and the polling data make this clear, the number of fatwas issued against { al Qaeda } [ Al-Qaeda ] and { Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] make this clear -- there has been a huge shift in the { Muslim } [ Islam ] world over the last nine years.CNN: Finally, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is reaffirming his plans to proceed with Cordoba House, the controversial { Islamic } [ Islam ] center near ground zero. What do you think of that?Zakaria: This is to be a { community center } [ Community centre ] that will have a { swimming pool } [ Swimming pool ], meeting rooms, athletic facilities, modeled after the { 92nd Street Y } [ 92nd Street Y ] {. } [ 92nd Street Y ] It will have { Jews } [ Jews ] and { Christians } [ Christians ] and { Muslims } [ Muslims ] on its board, it will have prayer rooms for { Jews } [ Jews ] and { Christians } [ Christians ] as well as { Muslims } [ Muslims ]. It will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage { interfaith } [ Interfaith dialogue ] dialogue.Now to me that sounds like precisely the { American } [ United States ] answer to { Muslim } [ Islam ] radicalism, to affirm a { Muslim } [ Islam ]-led process of { interfaith } [ Interfaith dialogue ] dialogue, of tolerance for other religions . the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together, this is such an { American } [ United States ] response to intolerance, extremism and violence. It is about inclusion, { dialogue } [ Dialogue ] and respect for other faiths.'."}, {"cnn/training/20d83fe3a98755949ed2ba975f9faaa00fbc95cd": "( {Rolling Stone } [ Rolling Stone ]) -- Walking into { Cleveland } [ Cleveland ], { Ohio } [ Ohio ]'s { Public Auditorium } [ Public Auditorium ] for the 27th aual { Rock and Roll Hall of Fame } [ Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ] induction ceremony last night, it was hard to not think of the { Titanic } [ RMS Titanic ] striking an iceberg on the very same day 100 years ago.In recent days { Axl Rose } [ Axl Rose ] and { Rod Stewart } [ Rod Stewart ], two of the biggest stars entering the Hall of Fame this year, pulled out of the show, making complete reunion performances by the { Faces } [ Faces (band) ] and Guns N' Roses impossible. { Red Hot Chili Peppers } [ Red Hot Chili Peppers ] guitarist { John Frusciante } [ John Frusciante ] opted not to come, and the { Beastie Boys } [ Beastie Boys ]' { Adam Yauch } [ Adam Yauch ] stayed home as he continues to recover from cancer.One might think that these absences would sink the induction ceremony somewhere deep into the { Atlantic Ocean } [ Atlantic Ocean ] {, } [ Atlantic Ocean ] but it turns out they didn't matter much at all. { In } [ Indiana ] fact {, } [ New York City ] it was one of the best { Hall of Fame } [ National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum ] induction ceremonies { in } [ Indiana ] recent memory {. } [ New York City ]\"I don't know that it matters who's here tonight, because it's about the music that these bands played,\" { Guns N' Roses } [ Guns N' Roses ] bassist { Duff McKagan } [ Duff McKagan ] said during his induction speech.

An { Abbottabad } [ Abbottabad ] resident even { tweeted } [ Twitter ] about the unusual sound of { helicopters } [ Helicopter ] flying over the city in the middle of the night.It wasn't much of a leap for reporters to ascertain that these { helicopters } [ Helicopter ] had particular features that had prevented them from being detected by { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] { radar } [ Radar ].Soon after the { SEALs } [ United States Navy SEALs ] had raided the { Abbottabad } [ Abbottabad ] command, { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] officials on the ground were interrogating { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s wives and children at the compound who told them that { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] had just been killed. None of this was going to stay secret for long.Indeed, it was Gen. A few hours after the raid, { Kayani } [ Abdul Qadeer Kayani ] told his { American } [ United States ] counterpart, Adm. Mike Mullen, \"Our people need to understand what happened here. We're not going to be able to manage the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] media without you confirming this. You can explain it to them. They need to understand that this was { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] and not just some ordinary { U. } [ United States ]S. operation.\"Mullen then told { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] and his national security team, \" {Kayani } [ Kayani ] has asked for us to go public,\" which swayed { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] to aounce the raid sooner than was plaed. (Obama wanted to wait for 100% { DNA } [ DNA ] confirmation that it was { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] {. } [ Osama bin Laden ] At the time of the { president } [ President of the United States ] {'s } [ President of the United States ] aouncement about the raid the confirmation was at 95 {%. } [ Percentage ])During his speech to the nation and world, { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] did not divulge the name of { SEAL Team Six } [ SEAL Team Six ] {, } [ SEAL Team Six ] saying only that a \"small team of { Americans } [ United States ] carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.\"A visit to { Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s lairIt quickly leaked that { SEAL Team Six } [ SEAL Team Six ] had executed the raid, but this was hardly surprising as the { SEALs } [ United States Navy SEALs ] are the principal Special Operations Forces in the Afghanistan/Pakistan theater, something that has been discussed in multiple news stories over the past several years and in bestselling books such as \"Lone Survivor\" by former Navy SEAL { Marcus Luttrell } [ Marcus Luttrell ].Perhaps if you had absolutely no knowledge of the { U. } [ United States ]S. military, or indeed access to Wikipedia where { SEAL Team Six } [ SEAL Team Six ] has had an entry since 2004, it would be news to you that { SEAL Team Six } [ SEAL Team Six ], along with the Army's { Delta Force } [ Delta Force ], are { America } [ United States ]'s premier counterterrorism units. Obviously, a mission to take out { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] would not be entrusted to any other than these elite units.So the notion that the public naming of the unit that killed { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] endangers the lives of its members and their families is overwrought. Members of { SEAL Team Six } [ SEAL Team Six ] are well able to take care of themselves and their families. And who first leaked the involvement of { SEAL Team Six } [ SEAL Team Six ] in the { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] operation remains unclear.It is just plain wrong that anyone in the { U. } [ United States ]S. government leaked the name of the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] asset in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ], Dr { Shakil Afridi } [ Shakil Afridi ], who was recruited by the agency in its quest to find { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]. This information first surfaced in a story in the { Guardian } [ The Guardian ] newspaper in July 2011 after { Afridi } [ Rafic Afridi ] was arrested by the { Pakistani } [ Pakistan ] intelligence service, { ISI } [ Inter-Services Intelligence ]. It is obvious that this information was leaked not by the { Americans } [ United States ] but the { Pakistanis } [ Pakistan ] who have done their own investigation of the bin Laden raid, which embarrassed them considerably.As to the notion that { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] has taken too much credit for the { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] raid, well he is commander-in-chief, and it was entirely his decision to launch the risky raid on { Abbottabad } [ Abbottabad ] based on the only fragmentary intelligence that { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] might be there.As Adm. William McRaven, who was the military commander of the bin Laden raid, told { CNN } [ CNN ]'s { Wolf Blitzer } [ Wolf Blitzer ] last month, \"at the end of the day, make no mistake about it, it was the president of the { United States } [ United States ] that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions, that was instrumental in the plaing process, because I pitched every plan to him.\"The raid decision was opposed by Vice { President } [ President of the United States ] { Joe Biden } [ Joe Biden ], who had run for the { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] nomination for the presidency against { Obama } [ Barack Obama ]. If { Biden } [ Joe Biden ] had won the { White House } [ White House ] in 2008, { Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] might still be alive.And the decision to do the raid was also opposed by { Secretary of Defense } [ Defence minister ] { Robert Gates } [ Robert Gates ], who had served every { president } [ President of the United States ] going back to { Richard Nixon } [ Richard Nixon ]. Gates was concerned about some kind of replay of the 1980 { Iran } [ Iran ] hostage rescue debacle, which helped to turn { President } [ President of the United States ] { Jimmy Carter } [ Jimmy Carter ] into a one-term { president } [ President of the United States ].The notion that the decision to greenlight the risky raid was made by anyone other than { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] is just plain silly, and it was a decision he made against the advice of both his { vice president } [ Vice President of the United States ] and his { secretary of defense } [ United States Secretary of Defense ].The { film } [ Film ] \"Dishonorable Disclosures\" gets even sillier. At one point one of the former officers interviewed for the film charges that the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration \"divulged to the world we are using { drone } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] technology.\" The fact that the { United States } [ United States ] uses { drones } [ Unmanned aerial vehicle ] in { Pakistan } [ Pakistan ] is one of the world's worst kept secrets. In fact, the { New America Foundation } [ New America (organization) ] where I work has maintained a public database of these attacks since early 2010.'First look at the { Osama bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] movieSimilarly, the claim that the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration has recently leaked information about the { Stuxnet } [ Stuxnet ] virus attacks on the { Iranian } [ Iran ] nuclear program to the { New York Times } [ The New York Times ] is overblown, as this information has been reported since 2010, and the { Iranians } [ Iran ] themselves publicly acknowledged that their nuclear program was under cyberattack two years ago. It is true that the { U. } [ United States ]S. role in the cyberattacks was disclosed in the { New York Times } [ The New York Times ].And in June, Attorney General { Eric Holder } [ Eric Holder ] appointed two federal prosecutors to investigate leaks including the { New York Times } [ The New York Times ] story about { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] ordering the cyberattacks against { Iran } [ Iran ] with the { Stuxnet } [ Stuxnet ] virus.There remains much that is unknown about the still-classified intelligence surrounding the { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ] raid, including:-- How did the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] find the real name of { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s courier who was the key to finding him?-- How was the courier's cell phone first tracked down?-- How was he tracked to { bin Laden } [ Osama bin Laden ]'s compound in { Abbottabad } [ Abbottabad ]?-- How did the { CIA } [ Central Intelligence Agency ] establish a safe house in { Abbottabad } [ Abbottabad ]?

Gen. Manaf Tlas -- on top of the desertion of many rank and file persoel, signal an erosion of the army's coherence in the face of the rebellion.Many of those at the top are determined to fight on to the end because they fear the personal consequences for them if they lose, analysts say.In what some saw as a turning point after more than 16 months of violence, { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] lost four top aides following an explosion in { Damascus } [ Damascus ] last week, as rebel forces attacked the capital and { Syria } [ Syria ]'s commercial hub, { Aleppo } [ Aleppo ].Reinforcements head to { Aleppo } [ Aleppo ]So far, { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] has shown no signs of quitting. But what's not yet clear is how much stomach he has for a continued bloody conflict, and whether he might be more inclined to negotiate a transition than some of his immediate entourage, Plesch said.If { al-Assad } [ Hafez al-Assad ] {'s } [ Hafez al-Assad ] ouster were the result of a \"palace coup,\" involving negotiation between some insiders and the { insurgency } [ Syrian insurgency ], slightly more continuity would ensue, said { Joshi } [ Joshi ]. However, such a transition is likely to be unstable because many rebels would refuse to accept it and would fight on.He believes it more likely that the regime collapses entirely and the { Syrian National Council } [ Syrian National Council ] -- an opposition coalition whose leadership resides outside of { Syria } [ Syria ] -- stakes a claim to lead the transition as part of a coalition also involving opposition figures within { Syria } [ Syria ] and { Kurdish } [ Kurdistan ] and liberal representatives.However, unlike { Libya } [ Libya ], where the { National Transitional Council } [ National Transitional Council ] presented a fairly unified voice as { Gadhafi } [ Muammar Gadhafi ]'s regime crumbled, the opposition in { Syria } [ Syria ] remains more fragmented and no credible transitional leader has yet come to the fore, Joshi said.Plesch agrees that while the { Syrian National Council } [ Syrian National Council ] \"aspires to be the linchpin in the transition,\" questions remain over how effective it could be and what support it commands among rebels on the ground.Ausama Monajed, who advised a previous president of the { Syrian National Council } [ Syrian National Council ], told { CNN } [ CNN ] in March that his group has a plan for a post-Assad era, including the formation of a transitional unity government and a body to draw up a new constitution and election laws, leading eventually to parliamentary and presidential elections.At the { time } [ Time (magazine) ] {, } [ Time (magazine) ] observers responded with { skepticism } [ Skepticism ] {. } [ Time (magazine) ] \"There's a lack of coordination amongst the insiders, and they represent the outsiders, not the insiders,\" said former { U. } [ United States ]S. \"It's not a coherent opposition leadership.\"What we need to know about { Syria } [ Syria ]Another scenario sees { Syria } [ Syria ] descend into a chaotic and bloody sectarian conflict, pitting { Syria } [ Syria ]'s majority { Sui Muslims } [ Sufism ] against the ruling { Alawite } [ Alawites ] sect, an offshoot of { Shiite Islam } [ Shia Islam ], and embroiling its { Christian } [ Christian people ], { Druze } [ Druze ] and other minority groups too. Such a conflict risks destabilizing the wider region.The recent defection of two key { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] figures, Tlas and { Syria } [ Syria ]'s ambassador to { Iraq } [ Iraq ], Nawaf Fares, means all { al-Assad } [ Hafez al-Assad ] has left is a narrow { Alawite } [ Alawites ] bloc with shrinking public support, Joshi said.If the regime collapses, the { Alawites } [ Alawites ] could retreat to strongholds in the northwest of the country around { Latakia } [ Latakia ] and attempt to reconstitute a state there, he said. Syria's { Kurds } [ Kurdish people ] could also seek greater autonomy, a move which would worry { Turkey } [ Turkey ], which has a troubled relationship with its own { Kurdish } [ Kurdish people ] population.However, Rime Allaf, an associate fellow at the { Chatham House } [ Chatham House ] { think tank } [ Think tank ], argues against making too much of { Syria } [ Syria ]'s sectarian tensions.The { regime } [ Regime ] \"has been using the { sectarian } [ Sectarianism ] line, but the { opposition } [ Opposition (politics) ] and the { rebels } [ Rebellion ] have increasingly repeated that they do not view it in those terms,\" she said. It means many people within that { regime } [ Regime ], whatever { religious denomination } [ Religious denomination ] they are, they don't necessarily agree with the way things are happening.\" {Sectarianism } [ Sectarianism ] aside, the large number of { militia } [ Militia ] groups that have taken up arms across { Syria } [ Syria ] will present a \"significant challenge\" to the country's future stability whoever ends up in power, { Joshi } [ C. Joshi ] said.They range from the pro-government { Shabiha } [ Shabiha ] militia groups, blamed by opposition activists for many of the more brutal attacks on civilians, to rebel hardline { Islamist } [ Islam ] groups and local networks that have formed to protect their villages.Faces of the { Free Syrian Army } [ Free Syrian Army ]He predicts that whatever { Syrian } [ Syria ] government results from the conflict will not be in charge of its whole territory, a problem made worse by the porous nature of the country's borders. If the { Syrian National Council } [ Syrian National Council ] ultimately does take charge, it may struggle to contain the worst excesses of the militia groups, he said.The { International Committee of the Red Cross } [ International Committee of the Red Cross ] said this month that it considers the conflict a \"non-international armed conflict\" -- or a { civil war } [ Civil war ] -- but some analysts say international forces are in fact involved.Opposition forces are being \"quite well-armed and probably trained by external clandestine forces from the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] states and probably from { Turkey } [ Turkey ] {,\" } [ Turkey ] Plesch said. Questions should also be asked about some { European } [ Europe ] and { North American } [ North America ] involvement, he added.At the same time, { Syria } [ Syria ]'s neighbors, which include { Turkey } [ Turkey ], { Iraq } [ Iraq ] and { Lebanon } [ Lebanon ], all have a stake in how the conflict plays out and exert varying degrees of influence within { Syria } [ Syria ].Part of the { international community } [ International community ] {'s } [ United Nations ] unease stems from { Syria } [ Syria ] {'s } [ United Nations ] position as a regional powerhouse.Another concern to those watching from the wings is { Syria } [ Syria ] {'s } [ Syria ] stockpile of { chemical weapons } [ Chemical weapon ] {. } [ Chemical weapon ]Syria's { foreign ministry } [ Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Syria) ] said Monday that the country has { chemical weapons } [ Chemical weapon ] that it would be willing to use against foreign attackers, although it sought to roll back the message Tuesday.Its remarks led to strong warnings from { U. } [ United States ]S.\" {Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration officials are now holding regular high-level meetings to discuss the ongoing situation in { Syria } [ Syria ] and begin thinking about { U. } [ United States ]S. { priorities } [ priorities ] in a post-Assad era, a senior { U. } [ United States ]S. official told { CNN } [ CNN ] Monday. The { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration has also stepped up its discussions with { Israel } [ Israel ], { Jordan } [ Jordan ] and { Turkey } [ Turkey ] about { Syria } [ Syria ]'s chemical weapons arsenalThe al-Assad regime \"probably has the largest and most advanced chemical warfare program in the Arab world,\" according to { Michael Eisenstadt } [ Michael Eisenstadt ], senior fellow and director of the military and security studies program at the { Washington Institute for Near East Policy } [ The Washington Institute for Near East Policy ].A { Syrian } [ Syria ] town's 'street of death'But there is good reason to be skeptical that this arsenal would ever be used, Joshi said. { Syrian } [ Syria ] commanders would not want to be held individually responsible with no regime to protect them, he said. Commanders are also well aware that the risk of such weapons getting into the hands of allies such as { Hezbollah } [ Hezbollah ] would likely induce external intervention, particularly from { Israel } [ Israel ].For some observers, the { international community } [ International community ]'s increasing focus on { Syria } [ Syria ] {'s } [ Syria ] weapons stockpile also conjures unwelcome echoes of the run-up to the { Iraq } [ Iraq ] war.Syrian allies { China } [ China ] and { Russia } [ Russia ], who last week blocked another { United Nations Security Council } [ United Nations Security Council ] resolution for new sanctions if Syrian government forces don't stop attacks against civilians, are opposed to the kind of foreign intervention seen in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] as well as in { Libya } [ Libya ] last year.Moscow indicated Tuesday that { Damascus } [ Damascus ] should refrain from making use of { chemical weapons } [ Chemical weapon ] in line with its ratification of { Geneva } [ Geneva ] protocols. \" {Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] policy is based on the understanding that { Syrian } [ Syria ] authorities will continue to strictly follow their international

another discussion about the future of our country in coection with his request of us to raise the debt ceiling.\"Meanwhile, { McCoell } [ Mark McCoell ] and { House Speaker } [ Speaker of the United States House of Representatives ] { John Boehner } [ John Boehner ] on Tuesday called for { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] to make public the specific spending cuts he will offer in a deficit-reduction deal.Both complained that { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] was deliberately holding up progress in negotiations by refusing to provide the details of his cost saving plans.\"Where are the { president } [ President of the United States ]'s spending cuts?\" asked { Boehner } [ John Boehner ], { R } [ Republican Party (United States) ]- {Ohio } [ Ohio ], the lead { GOP } [ Republican Party (United

{ Jay Carney } [ Jay Carney ] said { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] and McCoell were wrong because { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] detailed his proposed spending cuts more than a year ago.He added that { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] negotiators had yet to offer any details of their own on how to raise more revenue from taxes, \"and it would be helpful if they did.\" {House } [ United States House of Representatives ] { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] leader { Nancy Pelosi } [ Nancy Pelosi ], meanwhile, argued that the $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by { Congress } [ United States Congress ] in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations.\"Where are the cuts? They're in bills that you, Mr. { Speaker } [ Speaker of the United States House of Representatives ], have voted for,\" { Pelosi } [ Nancy Pelosi ], { D } [ Democratic Party (United States) ]- {California } [ California ], said Tuesday.Three weeks remain to cut a deal before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff go into effect on January 1.Without an agreement during the current lame-duck session of { Congress } [ United States Congress ], everyone's taxes will go up, and economists warn the impact of the fiscal cliff could cause another { recession } [ Recession ].Obama, { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] speak by telephone after { GOP } [ Republican Party (United States) ] counter-offerHowever, the { administration } [ Presidency of Barack Obama ] has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement when a new { Congress } [ United States Congress ] convenes in January.Obama has held a { campaign-style } [ Political campaign ] series of public events to back his call for extending { Bush-era } [ Presidency of George H. W. Bush ] tax cuts for 98% of { Americans } [ United States ] while allowing rates to return to higher 1990s levels on income over $250,000.The issue was central to his { re-election } [ 2008 United States presidential election ] in November, and { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] made clear on Monday that he intended to adhere to his belief that the wealthy must contribute more.\"I'm willing to compromise a little bit,\" { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] said at a { Michigan } [ Michigan ] { diesel engine } [ Diesel engine ] plant. However, he said higher { tax } [ Tax ] rates on the the top income brackets was \"a principle I'm not going to compromise on.\"The { president } [ President of the United States ]'s public push appears to be working as polls show that most { Americans } [ United States ] back the { president } [ President of the United States ]'s position.A new { Politico } [ Politico ] {/George Washington University } [ George Washington University ] survey on Monday said 60% of respondents supported { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] {'s } [ Barack Obama ] proposal compared with 38% who opposed it.On Tuesday, a { Gallup } [ Gallup (company) ] poll showed that 70% of adult { Americans } [ United States ] want { Congress } [ United States Congress ] and the { White House } [ White House ] to reach a compromise that would avoid the fiscal cliff. A similar { Gallup } [ Gallup (company) ] poll last week said 62% wanted compromise.The deficit-reduction debate hinges on the tax issue, with { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] opposing any increase in tax rates in their quest to shrink government, while { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] and { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] want to secure more tax revenue as part of a broader package.Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliffBoth sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue, but { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets.Republicans oppose the return to higher rates, saying it will inhibit job growth because small business owners declare their profits as personal income and therefore would face a tax increase.In response, { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] and { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] note that their plan -- already approved by the { Senate } [ United States Senate ] and needing { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] approval to be signed into law by the president -- affects just 2% of taxpayers and 3% of small business owners.While { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] argue those small business owners account for about half of all business income, { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] say that's because they include law firms, { hedge funds } [ Hedge fund ] traders and other high-income operations.Obama and { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] met face to face on Sunday for the first time since November 16. It also was their first one-on-one meeting in more than a year, when deficit talks broke down.The outline for a deal has become clear in recent weeks. Both sides agree that more { revenue } [ Revenue ] from { taxes } [ Tax ] should be part of the equation, with { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] seeking $1.6 trillion and { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] offering $800 billion.A source close to the talks said Tuesday that the { White House } [ White House ] had floated the idea of dropping the revenue target to $1.2 { trillion } [ Orders of magnitude (numbers) ] {, } [ Orders of magnitude (numbers) ] then went up to $1.4 { trillion } [ Orders of magnitude (numbers) ] on Monday.Later, { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] spokesman { Michael Steel } [ Michael Steel ] said his side made a counteroffer to the { White House } [ White House ] \"that would achieve tax and entitlement reform to solve our looming debt crisis and create more { American } [ United States ] jobs.\"Steel also said { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] and { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] spoke on the phone after the { Republican } [ Republican Party (United States) ] proposal was floated. Steel provided no further details on the counteroffer or the phone conversation, and repeated { Boehner } [ John Boehner ]'s earlier assertion that { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] were waiting for { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] to identify specific spending cuts he would be willing to make.Federal Reserve may buy more bondsBoehner's side wants additional revenue to come from tax reform, such as eliminating some deductions and loopholes, while Obama demands the higher rates on income over $250,000 for families as part of the equation.Republicans also seek savings from entitlement programs totaling another $800 billion or so, while { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] has proposed $400 billion in reduced entitlement costs. { Social Security } [ Social Security (United States) ] would not be included in the { president } [ President of the United States ]'s plan.Another sticky issue -- whether the need to raise the federal debt ceiling early next year should be part of the discussion -- also remains unresolved. { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] says absolutely not, while { Boehner } [ Steve Boehner ] says that any increase in government borrowing to pay its bills must be offset by spending cuts.Graham's comments this week showed that { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] plan to regroup around negotiations to raise the { debt ceiling } [ United States debt ceiling ].From my home to the house: How to fix the fiscal cliffHe noted that { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] proposed making permanent a process originated by McCoell that would allow the president to increase the debt ceiling and { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to then try to block it, an unlikely scenario given { Democratic } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] control of the { Senate } [ United States Senate ]. He's { president } [ President (corporate title) ] {. } [ President (corporate title) ]\"However, a top { House } [ United States House of Representatives ] { Democrat } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] said that exploiting the { debt ceiling } [ United States debt ceiling ] for political gain would backfire on { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ].\"Threatening to tank the entire economy, which is what would happen if we ever defaulted on our debt, is not a kind of negotiating strategy that is going to be popular with the { American } [ United States ] people,\" Rep. Chris Van Hollen told { MSNBC } [ MSNBC ] on Monday.It remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013, after the fiscal cliff takes effect.Without action now on the fiscal cliff, the nonpartisan { Tax Policy Center } [ Tax Policy Center ] estimates that { middle-class } [ Middle class ] families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes. Even with a deal, revisions in the { tax code } [ Tax law ] and other changes would mean everyone pays a bit more starting next year.All signs point toward a two-step approach sought by { Obama } [ Barack Obama ], with initial agreement now on some version of his tax plan with targets set for comprehensive negotiations on a broader deficit reduction deal in the new { Congress } [ United States Congress ] next year.Opinion: Generals, get real and cut { Pentagon } [ The Pentagon ] spendingSuch an outcome would put off the main worry of the fiscal cliff, the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts that would result in higher rates for everyone.Obama and { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] say they would then be ready to negotiate significant savings from entitlement programs, while { Republicans } [ Republican Party (United States) ] say they need to first see commitment on entitlement reforms before accepting any higher tax rates.McCoell, { R } [ Republican Party (United States) ]- {Kentucky } [ Kentucky ], warned on the { Senate } [ United States Senate ] floor on Tuesday that \"until the president gets specific about cuts, nobody should trust { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] to put a dime in new revenue toward real deficit reduction or to stop their shakedown of the taxpayers at the top 2 {%. } [ Percentage ]\"He and { Boehner } [ John Boehner ] want { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] to take some of the political heat for proposing cuts to entitlement programs and other government spending.On Tuesday, congressional { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] rejected any cuts to the { Medicaid } [ Medicaid ] health care system for poor and disabled { Americans } [ United States ] as part of a fiscal cliff deal. The opposition by { Democrats } [ Democratic Party (United States) ] showed the pressure { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] faces from his { liberal } [ Liberalism in the United States ] base to avoid significant changes to the entitlement program that benefits millions.Some in { Congress } [ United States Congress ] warn that the legislative process will need at least a week to work through potentially complex measures from any proposed deal, meaning there is a { de facto } [ De facto ] deadline of { Christmas Day } [ Christmas ] at the very latest for negotiators.Retiring Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, predicted Tuesday on { MSNBC } [ MSNBC ] that a deal would get worked out in a week's time.\"It would be wise on their part not to come too quickly with a deal because that would give all the interest groups a chance to get organized and try to kill it,\" Conrad said. \"And we know that on the { right } [ Right-wing politics ], on the { left } [ Left-wing politics ], special interest groups are just salivating at the chance to attack any agreement because, look, any agreement is going to have controversy attached to it.\"iReport: How will the fiscal cliff affect you? {CNN } [ CNN ]'s { Dana Bash } [ Dana Bash ], Deirdre Walsh, Ashley Killough and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.'."}, {"cnn/training/1a019a4b4aa81180cbf77e77e0c93d9b08364652": "(CNN) -- The failure of the P5+1 (the { United States } [ United States ], { United Kingdom } [ United Kingdom ], { France } [ France ], { China } [ China ], { Russia } [ Russia ] plus { Germany } [ Germany ]) to reach agreement with { Iran } [ Iran ] Saturday in { Geneva } [ Geneva ] is a good thing if it allows the { United States } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] to sort out what really divides them on the { Iranian } [ Iran ] nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days.That the { French } [ France ] -- not the { United States } [ United States ] -- seem to have taken the lead in stiffening the allies' demands with { Iran } [ Iran ] is in itself a reflection of those differences.And while a high-ranking { U. } [ United States ]S. delegation headed to { Israel } [ Israel ] Sunday to brief the { Israelis } [ Israel ] on the talks, bridging the gap there won't be that easy.Where you stand in { life } [ Life ] has a great deal to do with where you sit.And it reveals the sensitivities of an { Israeli } [ Israel ] leader who's far more invested politically in seeing a nuke-free { Iran } [ Iran ], far more suspicious of { Iranian } [ Iran ] motives and far more worried about the consequences of a bad deal for { Israel } [ Israel ] than a { U. } [ United States ]S. President who's concerned more about what happens if there's no deal and { Israel } [ Israel ] or the { United States } [ United States ] slides toward military confrontation with the mullahs who rule { Iran } [ Iran ].That gap between the { United States } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] is real. And it should neither be { trivialized } [ Trivialism ] nor { exaggerated } [ Exaggeration ]. But short of a final deal in which { Iran } [ Iran ] abandons its nuclear ambitions, it may not be bridgeable. These two { allies } [ Alliance ] will need to manage it as best they can. And here's why.Big and Small PowersWith non-predatory neighbors to its { north } [ North America ] and { south } [ South America ] and fish to its { east } [ East America ] and { west } [ Western United States ], the { United States } [ United States ] enjoys a level of physical security unprecedented in the history of great and small powers. That gives { America } [ United States ] a margin for error that the small power simply caot afford.Indeed, { Americans } [ Americans ] have a hard time internalizing what it's like to be a small { nation } [ Nation ] living on the knife's edge, whose tiny physical size, isolation and sense of vulnerability exists alongside its power and strength.I don't think { Iran } [ Iran ] wants nuclear weapons to launch a { first strike } [ Pre-emptive nuclear strike ] against { Israel } [ Israel ] {. } [ Israel ] But it's impossible to ignore, let alone trivialize, { Israeli } [ Israel ] security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard, particularly in the face of { Iran } [ Iran ] {'s } [ Iran ] rhetoric, regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years.Israel isn't some hapless victim, a piece of driftwood bobbing about on a turbulent sea; it's a dynamic nation (and a nuclear weapons state) with great military power with the capacity if need be to deal with { Iran } [ Iran ] too. But that doesn't take away from the reality that it's a small country living in a dangerous neighborhood.Netanyahu's World ViewAll { Israeli } [ Israel ] { Prime Ministers } [ Prime Minister of Israel ] are said to sleep with one eye open. Benjamin { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] sleeps with two eyes open. No { Israeli } [ Israel ] { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Israel ] can afford to take { Israel } [ Israel ] {'s } [ Israel ] security for granted. And none does. All { Israeli } [ Israel ] leaders function in a high threat environment. But in { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] {'s } [ Israel ] case, it defines his world and creates an us-against-them sensibility that extends to { Israel } [ Israel ] {'s } [ Israel ] adversaries and its friends too.He has been deeply suspicious of { American } [ United States ] motives for many years and believes the { United States } [ United States ] doesn't understand the { Arabs } [ Arab people ] or { Israel } [ Israel ]'s security predicament. You live in { Chevy Chase } [ Chevy Chase, Washington ], he's said to me on more than one occasion; we live in a dangerous neighborhood with little margin for error.I never argued with him. What was the point? Unlike { Israel } [ Israel ], there is no existential threat to the { United States } [ United States ] from any external enemy largely because of where we are. But { Israel } [ Israel ] {'s } [ Israel ] history has been marked by a continuous series of threats -- large and small -- by virtue of where the { Israelis } [ Israel ] are. However powerful they have become, that legacy endures. And combined with the dark history of the { Jewish } [ Jews ] people culminating in the { Nazi } [ Nazi Germany ] { genocide } [ Genocide ], it has left an enduring mark.The notion that { Israelis } [ Israelis ] fight the { Arabs } [ Arabs ] during the day and win and fight the { Nazis } [ Nazism ] at night and lose carries particular resonance with this { Israeli } [ Israel ] Prime Minister. The late { Israeli } [ Israel ] Prime Minister { Yitzhak Rabin } [ Yitzhak Rabin ] never used { Holocaust } [ The Holocaust ] imagery to describe the contemporary threats to { Israel } [ Israel ]'s security.Ehud Barak refused to use { Hitler } [ Adolf Hitler ] analogies when discussing { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ] Netanyahu does, repeatedly. Iran is { Nazi Germany } [ Nazi Germany ]; former { Iranian } [ Iran ] President { Mahmoud Ahmadinejad } [ Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ] is { Hitler } [ Adolf Hitler ] and we're in 1938 on the nuclear issue. It infuses his { rhetoric } [ Rhetoric ] and his { world view } [ World view ] {. } [ World view ] And while { Rouhani } [ Hassan Rouhani ] has changed the tone and may be genuinely looking for an agreement, the charm offensive hasn't dulled the acuteness of { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] {'s } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] suspicions.Consequences of { Israeli-American } [ Israeli Americans ] TensionsThis { world view } [ World view ] poses enormous challenges for a { U. } [ United States ]S. administration, partly because it's validated by { Iran } [ Iran ] {'s } [ Iran ] own past rhetoric and actions and because { Iran } [ Iran ] has tried to hide suspected military aspects of its nuclear program. Leaving an angry, aggrieved { Israel } [ Israel ] in the wake of an interim deal with { Iran } [ Iran ] that is judged to be a bad deal carries tremendous risk and consequence.First, the focus is now on an interim agreement -- a first step. That means that we won't know the end state for at least six months. { Time } [ Time ] is both an enemy and an ally here. The step-by-step approach creates time to test intentions.It also affords time for { Iran } [ Iran ] to continue to advance aspects of its { nuclear program } [ Nuclear program of Iran ] and to develop a break-out capacity to dash for weapons. And they are going to be a rocky six months if { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] concludes that the interim arrangements reached in { Geneva } [ Geneva ] work to { Iran } [ Iran ] {'s } [ Iran ] advantage.Going right to the { endgame } [ Endgame (sports) ] would be ideal. But it's just not feasible. There's too much suspicion and mistrust. And neither { Iran } [ Iran ] nor the { United States } [ United States ] are prepared for that. So there's built in { U. } [ United States ]S.- {Israeli } [ Israel ] tension inherent in the structure of the talks themselves.Second, while the { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of the United Kingdom ]'s fierce reaction to events in { Geneva } [ Geneva ] is driven by genuine anger and concern, it's also designed to begin to stir up opposition in { Congress } [ United Kingdom Congress ]. And it won't take much stirring.There's zero capacity in { Congress } [ United States Congress ] to give { Iran } [ Iran ] the benefit of the doubt on anything. And { Congress } [ United States Congress ] is already inclined to adopt the { Israeli } [ Israel ] view that what's required now is more pressure on the mullahs rather than less, including additional sanctions.The idea that the { Obama } [ Barack Obama ] administration would want to place itself in a position of defending a deal with { Iran } [ Iran ] that { Israel } [ Israel ] and much of { Congress } [ United States Congress ] oppose -- and appear implicitly to be defending the { Iranians } [ Iran ] in the process -- defies the laws of political gravity, particularly for a much weakened president.To overcome these political downsides and go into battle mode, the { administration } [ Executive (government) ] would really have to have a compelling interim agreement that's sound and defensible.Third, the { United States } [ United States ] is measuring an agreement with { Iran } [ Iran ] at this stage not against an ideal end state -- { Iran } [ Iran ] capitulates and surrenders any hope of maintaining the capacity to enrich { uranium } [ Uranium ], let alone make bombs. It's evaluating success in terms of what's practical and what will happen if no deal is reached, namely the slide toward the use of military force against { Iran } [ Iran ].Israelis don't want a war with { Iran } [ Iran ] either; but they are much more comfortable with threatening military action and conditioned to accept the possibility that force may have to be used, even if the end state is an imperfect one and { Iran } [ Iran ] sets about rebuilding a nuclear program. The key issue is putting time on the clock to delay { Iran } [ Iran ] getting { nukes } [ Nuclear weapon ] -- preferably through { diplomacy } [ Diplomacy ], but if necessary by force.Fourth, an already problematic { Israeli-Palestinian } [ State of Palestine ] peace process is going to get a lot more complicated. Narrowing the gaps on borders, { refugees } [ Refugee ] and { Jerusalem } [ Jerusalem ] was always going to be tough; but now getting { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] to make decisions will be almost impossible.Israel-Palestinian peace process at riskWhether the administration thought through the overlapping of a peace process with a nine-month timeline and a negotiation with { Iran } [ Iran ] of six months now aligned to come to fruition right around the same time isn't clear. But the coincidence of the timing couldn't be worse.The odds that this { Prime Minister } [ Prime Minister of Israel ] would make decisions on historic issues with the { Palestinians } [ State of Palestine ] before there was clarity on { Iran } [ Iran ] {'s } [ Iran ] nuclear program were always slim to none. For { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ], the { Palestinians } [ State of Palestine ] are a long-term challenge; { Iran } [ Iran ] is an imminent, acute problem. And a { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] who believes the { Americans } [ United States ] aren't taking him seriously on { Iran } [ Iran ] is certain to be withholding when it comes to the peace process.To satisfy { Israeli } [ Israel ] requirements, an interim agreement would have to do at least three things: first, avoid doing anything that dismantles the sanctions regime and removes real pressure on { Iran } [ Iran ] to cut the final deal; second, make it impossible for { Iran } [ Iran ] to use the next six months to advance in a significant way any of the aspects of its nuclear program -- not just to freeze { Iran } [ Iran ]'s program but to actually set it back significantly. And finally, not to do anything with regard to sanctions that can't be reversed.All of this may not be possible. But in the next 10 days before negotiations with { Iran } [ Iran ] resume, everything should be done to try to make certain that { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ] and { Jerusalem } [ Jerusalem ] understand one another and to ensure that there's as much confidence and trust going forward as possible.An orchestrated { good cop/bad cop } [ Good cop/bad cop ] routine between allies could be helpful in negotiating with { Iran } [ Iran ] {. } [ Iran ] A rift that signals the { United States } [ United States ] and { Israel } [ Israel ] are fundamentally out of step is not.There are no happy or perfect endings here. At best, the choice is between an imperfect interim agreement that buys six months to determine whether { Iran } [ Iran ] is prepared to give up its quest for a nuclear weapons capacity or no agreement and an inevitable slide toward military confrontation.As of now the { United States } [ United States ] sees the advantage of the former; { Netanyahu } [ Benjamin Netanyahu ] doesn't. The { United States } [ United States ] has no stake in concluding an agreement with { Iran } [ Iran ] that leaves { Israel } [ Israel ] angry, aggrieved and vulnerable. So, the two sides will find a way to work this through. But for now, buckle your seat belts. We could be in for one bumpy ride.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.\"."}, {"cnn/training/256f480ac71540ceaea72207c2e97a96364869b5": "Preliminary results in Sunday's referendum on whether { Ukraine } [ Ukraine ]'s { Crimea } [ Crimea ] region should join { Russia } [ Russia ] or become an independent state show overwhelming support for { Russia } [ Russia ].With 75% percent of the ballots counted, close to 96% of voters want to become part of that country, according to the Crimean Electoral Commission.

If not, would { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ]'s style of governance change?The answers will have a major impact on { Syria } [ Syria ]'s neighbors and the { Middle East } [ Middle East ].It's a complicated web of affairs, laced with deep { historical } [ History ], { political } [ Politics ] and { religious } [ Religion ] ties. There are several factors to consider: { Syria } [ Syria ]'s relationships with { Iran } [ Iran ] and { Hezbollah } [ Hezbollah ]; its presence in neighboring { Lebanon } [ Lebanon ], a country struggling to maintain a delicate balance among its religious and ethnic sects; and the roles of { Gulf Arab } [ Arab states of the Persian Gulf ] states like { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] and { Qatar } [ Qatar ].We asked four people to share their thoughts on the coection between { Syria } [ Syria ] and the current state of affairs in the region, posing the question: \"What kind of impact do the events in { Syria } [ Syria ] have on the rest of the { Middle East } [ Middle East ]?\"Leverett: War could draw in other countriesnHillary Ma Leverett teaches foreign policy at { American University } [ American University ] in { Washington } [ Washington (state) ].

She is also co-author of the { blog } [ Blog ] RaceForIran.com.The civil war in { Syria } [ Syria ] is likely to prove a watershed for the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] {'s } [ Syria ] balance of power. It has the potential to become a full-blown regional war that could spill over into other countries and bring those countries into conflict, through { proxies } [ Proxy war ] and perhaps even directly.On top of that, the temptation to arm and fund { Syrian } [ Syria ] rebels could spark a { great power } [ Great power ] confrontation over { Syria } [ Syria ] {. } [ Great power ] { Russia } [ Russia ] and { China } [ China ] have made it clear that that they oppose foreign military intervention in { Syria } [ Syria ], especially by the { United States } [ United States ]. And in { Russia } [ Russia ] {'s } [ Russia ] case, it has made it clear that it will protect { Syria } [ Syria ], its beachhead in the { Mediterranean } [ Mediterranean Sea ]. { Russia } [ Russia ] has a longtime relationship with the country, and it has drawn a { red line } [ Red line (politics) ] against { U. } [ United States ]S. intervention.S. { invasion of Iraq } [ 2003 invasion of Iraq ] and { Western } [ Western world ] military intervention in { Libya } [ Libya ].If you watch the { Western } [ Western world ] or { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] states' media, you would have the impression that everyone in { Syria } [ Syria ] opposes and is fighting the government. This is not true. In { Syria } [ Syria ] {, } [ Syria ] a significant portion of the population is disaffected {, } [ Syria ] but the majority still supports the { regime } [ Regime ] {. } [ Syria ] A series of public polls, for example, show that the { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] government still retains a majority of the support of the population. The reason? The basic majority, about 55% of the population, is terrified at the prospect of the other 45% forming a Sui { Islamist } [ Islam ] tyray over the country. The 55% have held together -- as they have for decades -- to essentially hold { Syria } [ Syria ] together as an independent, { secular } [ Secularity ] political order.There are now several countries, principally { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Qatar } [ Qatar ], { Turkey } [ Turkey ], { France } [ France ] and the { U. } [ United States ]S., that have aligned themselves with the angry minority. The strategic problem for these countries is that even if { rebels } [ Rebellion ] are militarily successful and force { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] from power, the new government would be one that roughly 55% of the population does not want and/or fears. This means that without a negotiated way forward, we know that the outcome of arming or supporting the rebels means -- at a minimum -- only sustained violence and instability in { Syria } [ Syria ] and for the region.Tabler: 'Cold war' between { Shiites } [ Shia Islam ], SuisnAndrew J. Tabler is the Next Generation { fellow } [ Fellow ] at the { Washington Institute for Near East Policy } [ The Washington Institute for Near East Policy ] {. } [ Washington Institute for Near East Policy ] He is also the author of \"In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of { Washington } [ George Washington ]'s Battle with { Syria } [ Syria ].\"The events in { Syria } [ Syria ] impact the general struggle between { Iran } [ Iran ] and the { Sui-Arab } [ Sui Arab Party ] alliance in the region. The minority Shiite { Alawite } [ Alawites ]-dominated regime in { Syria } [ Syria ] is backed by { Iran } [ Iran ], and the majority of { Syrians } [ Syria ] are { Sui Muslims } [ Sufism ].There is sort of a { cold war } [ Cold war (general term) ] taking place between the two sides. I think you can see that playing out in terms of { Qatar } [ Qatar ], the { United Arab Emirates } [ United Arab Emirates ], { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] and Turkey clearly on the side of the opposition in { Syria } [ Syria ], while the { Iranians } [ Iran ] are strongly backing the regime. What's at stake is larger than what's within { Syria } [ Syria ]'s borders.Syria is a keystone of the { Iranian } [ Iran ] alliance. It allows { Iran } [ Iran ] to protect its power on the shores of the { Mediterranean } [ Mediterranean Sea ] and its border with { Israel } [ Israel ], particularly its support of { Hezbollah } [ Hezbollah ] in { Lebanon } [ Lebanon ].And the more this violence continues, especially with the { regime } [ Regime ] using brutal force, the more it enrages people in the Sui Arab countries.A lot of this is about the future of the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world and what the basis of these governments will be. For so long, it has been based on narrow regimes and, in the case of { Syria } [ Syria ], a narrow minority regime. Whatever comes next is likely to be a { majoritarian } [ Majoritarianism ] system that has a larger base.Haddad: Interference would change the dynamicsnBassam Haddad is the director of { Middle East } [ Middle East ] studies at { George Mason University } [ George Mason University ]. He is also the homepage editor of Jadaliyya, an independent online { Arab } [ Arab world ] affairs magazine produced by the { Arab Studies Institute } [ Arab Studies Institute ]. Haddad wrote \"Business Networks in Syria: The Political Economy of Authoritarian Resilience.\"The { Syrian } [ Syria ] situation is complex like any other uprising, but the situation has added complexity because it is at the juncture of several conflicts in the region. Those struggles involve { local } [ Local government ], { regional } [ Region ] and { international } [ International relations ] power plays that make the situation a lot more charged.For instance, we have { Syria } [ Syria ] at the center of the { Arab-Israeli conflict } [ Arab\u2013Israeli conflict ] {. } [ Arab\u2013Israeli conflict ] Syria is part of an axis, so to speak, with { Iran } [ Iran ] and { Hezbollah } [ Hezbollah ], confronting { imperialism } [ Imperialism ] in various forms from inside and outside the region, particularly in relation to { U. } [ United States ]S.There is also resistance to the conservative { Arab } [ Arab world ] camp that includes { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Qatar } [ Qatar ] and other conservative countries that are usually allies with the { United States } [ United States ].For all these reasons, { Syria } [ Syria ] {'s } [ Syria ] position in the { region } [ Middle East ] is pivotal. This is not simply another { uprising } [ Rebellion ] against a { dictator } [ Dictator ]. It is also being transformed by other players into an effort to redraw the political map of the region and curtail further protests elsewhere.A lot of the anti-regime actors and analysts are placed in an odd position. They do not support the { regime } [ Regime ] or the turn that the { uprising } [ Rebellion ] has taken since fall of last year. So perhaps the task is to build an independent opposition away from the dictates of { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ], { Qatar } [ Qatar ] or the { United States } [ United States ]. Most people in the region are opposed to the { Syrian } [ Syria ] regime's domestic behavior during the past decades, but they are not opposed to its regional role. The problem is the { Syrian } [ Syria ] regime's internal repression, not its external policies.If there is no interference from the outside, the uprisings will be seen as legitimate. If it becomes { regional } [ Region ] and you bring in the { U. } [ United States ]S. and { Israel } [ Israel ] in a fight against the { Syrian } [ Syria ] regime, it changes the strategic dynamics of the conflict -- and not just the players involved.Due: Democracy takes timenMichele Due is the director of the { Atlantic Council } [ Atlantic Council ] {'s } [ Atlantic Council ] Rafik Hariri Center for the { Middle East } [ Middle East ] in { Washington } [ Washington, D.C. ]. Previously, she was a { Middle East } [ Middle East ] affairs specialist at the { State Department } [ United States Department of State ] and the { White House } [ White House ] {. } [ White House ]When I travel to the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], it is striking how in the eastern part of the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world, { sectarian } [ Sectarianism ] issues are right on the surface of public discourse and shape the way people look at the uprisings.For example, the same person might support the uprising in { Syria } [ Syria ] but not the one in { Bahrain } [ Bahrain ], or vice versa, depending on whether that person is { Sui } [ Sufism ] or { Shiite } [ Shia Islam ] Muslim.There are many reasons for this, including the rise of { Iran } [ Iran ] and the unleashing of sectarian sentiments in { Iraq } [ Iraq ] after { Saddam Hussein } [ Saddam Hussein ] was deposed. Sectarian feeling is less pronounced in the western part of the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world {, } [ Saudi Arabia ] which is largely populated by { Suis } [ Sufism ] {. } [ Saudi Arabia ]Last summer, { Saudi Arabia } [ Saudi Arabia ] and the other { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] states abandoned { al-Assad } [ Hafez al-Assad ] and withdrew their ambassadors from { Syria } [ Syria ]. Perhaps they did this partly because they saw how strong the popular uprising in { Syria } [ Syria ] was and assessed that { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ] might not be able to outlast it. Perhaps they also saw a chance of getting a { Sui } [ Sui dynasty ] majority government into power in { Syria } [ Syria ], which would make the { Gulf } [ Persian Gulf ] states more comfortable. Probably, their desire to change the regional { sectarian } [ Sectarianism ] and { political } [ Politics ] power balance has largely dictated their policies toward { Syria } [ Syria ] {. } [ Syria ] Syria has provided the avenue through which { Iran } [ Iran ] could project political influence into { Lebanon } [ Lebanon ] and { Palestine } [ State of Palestine ] through { Hezbollah } [ Hezbollah ] and { Hamas } [ Hamas ].The { Hamas } [ Hamas ] link with { Syria } [ Syria ] has already been broken. Hamas has turned against { al-Assad } [ Bashar al-Assad ], partly out of support for the Syrian { Muslim Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] and partly because { Damascus } [ Damascus ] is no longer a safe haven for them. Hamas is now working on closer relations with { Egypt } [ Egypt ], where the { Brotherhood } [ Muslim Brotherhood ] controls close to half of the parliament, is ruing a candidate for president and is likely to have a strong presence in the new { Cabinet } [ Cabinet (government) ].We are not going to see in any of the { Arab } [ Arab world ] countries a neat transition to a { democracy } [ Democracy ] in a year or two. Countries do not make that shift -- from { authoritarianism } [ Authoritarianism ] to { democracy } [ Democracy ] -- so rapidly. Achieving a well-functioning { democracy } [ Democracy ] could happen in perhaps 10 to 15 years. There will be setbacks, bloodshed and disappointments along the way. But we have to stay with this for a while, develop { sustainable } [ Sustainability ] strategies to help these countries, and not abandon them a year or two into their transitions.The opportunity to establish functioning democracies in the { Arab } [ Arab world ] world is a tremendous and historic one for the { Middle East } [ Middle East ], and the risks if these transitions fail -- with all that could bring in terms of instability, safe havens for terrorists, etc. -- are also enormous.The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors.'."}, {"cnn/training/89fd52b1847758c733f09f7984dabd9e7523fefd": "Editor's note: upwave is { Turner Broadcasting } [ Turner Broadcasting System ] {'s } [ Turner Broadcasting System ] new lifestyle brand designed to entertain the health into you!
