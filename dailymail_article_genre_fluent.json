A chemical called azodicarbonamide (ADA) which is used to make yoga mats (left) has also been found in close to 500 food products including many 'healthy' breads, salad croutons and fruit strudels (right)Most of the items which contain ADA are bread, pre-made sandwiches, croutons and snacks.According to { EWG } [ European Union Magazine ], the synthetic additive has not been a problem for the federal { Food and Drug Administration } [ Food and Drug Administration ] - because the low levels of 45 { parts per million } [ Parts-per notation ] are not known to be toxic.However a study by the { World Health Organization } [ World Health Organization ] showed that when handed in large quantities, the chemical causes respiratory problems including { asthma } [ Asthma ] and skin sensitization.ADA has not undergone extensive testing for its long-term affects on health.According to FoodBabe, who has campaigned against the use of ADA in foods, when the chemical partially degrades with the heat of processing, it can form trace amounts of semicarbazide, which shows carcinogenicity and also has been shown to cause tumors.Subway last month aounced that it was removing the ingredient Azodicarbonamiden (ADA) as part of an ongoing effort to improve recipes in the U.S. (it nwas not being used in sandwiches in the { UK } [ United Kingdom ], much of { Europe } [ Europe ] and { Australian } [ Australia ] where the additive is baed).Subway founder Fred DeLuca (pictured) aounced last month that { ADA } [ ADA (supermarket) ] was being removed from breads used to make their sandwiches in the { U. } [ United States ]S.According to Environmental Working Group, each product on the list below includes ADA:Aladdin Bakers: Jumbo Bagels (Ciamon Raisin) {America's Choice } [ America's Choice ]: Muffin Sandwiches (Turkey, Sausage, Egg & Cheese)Amigos: TortillasArcher Farms: Simply Balanced 100% Whole Wheat Hamburger BunsArnold: Bakery Light 100% Whole Wheat Bread/ Wheat Sandwich RollsArtichoke Basilles Pizza Co: Margherita PizzaArtisan Fresh: Jumbo Wheat HoagieAunt Hattie's: Onion Buns/ Potato Hamburger Enriched BunsAunt Millie's: Honey & Hamburger Buns/ Whole Grain BreadBagel-Fuls: Bagel Filled With Cream Cheese, OriginalBaker's Treat: Big Texas Cheese Roll PastriesBall Park: Flame Grilled Barbeque Chicken Slider/ Flame Grilled Beef Sliders/ Flame Grilled Cheese Burger Sliders/ Hot Dog BunsBell's: Traditional StuffingBetty Crocker: Pasta Caesar Salad/ Suddenly Pasta Salad, CaesarBig Az: CheeseburgerBimbo: Bread Crumbs/ Double Fiber Bread/ Large Wheat Bread/ Sabor Chocolate/ Toasted BreadToasted Bread, OriginalBon Appetit: Apple Danish/ Blueberry Cream Pastry/ Cheese & Berries Danish/ Cheese Croissant/Super Ciamon RollBridgford: Ciamon Pull-Apart Monkey Bread/ Ready-Dough Frozen White Bread DoughBrownberry: Chicago Hot Dog Rolls/ Kaiser Sandwich Buns / Sandwich Buns, Onion/ Sausage Rolls, OriginalBuy: Hot Dog BunsButternut: 1/2 Loaf White Enriched Bread/ All Whole Grain 100% Whole Wheat Bread/ Brown' N Serve Enriched Rolls/ Deluxe Buns/ Enriched Burger Buns, Sliced/ Enriched Hot Dog Buns, SlicedHearty Rye Bread/ Honey Wheat Bread/ Italian Bread/ Large Enriched Bread/ Sliced Buns, SeededWhole Grain White Bread/ Whole Wheat BreadCastillo: Castillo CroissantsCentrella: Hot Dog Buns, Enriched/ Restaurant Style Caesar CrotonsChef M.J.

The { defender } [ Defender (association football) ] had been on the { pitch } [ Football pitch ] for all of three minutes and the touch could well have been his first.From such begiings do crises develop and it is no exaggeration to say that { Brentford } [ Brentford F.C. ] could have been another two goals to the good in the first 45 minutes. How { Jonathan Douglas } [ Jonathan Douglas ] missed a sitter, only he will know.A couple of minutes into the second half and { Kevin Wilsons } [ Kevin Wilsons ] decision to up-end { Gray } [ Callum Gray (footballer) ] resulted in { Alex Pritchard } [ Alex Pritchard ] making it three from the penalty spot.Even then { Forest } [ Nottingham Forest F.C. ] kept battling and { Michail Antonio } [ Michail Ant\u00f3nio ] scored from long range near the end after { Day Fox } [ Day Fox ] had been taken off on a stretcher leaving the home side with ten men.What had started as a promising opportunity to put things right was eventually a face-saving exercise.Forest's { Chris Burke } [ Chris Burke (footballer) ] hurdles a challenge by { Brentford } [ Brentford F.C. ] defender { Harlee Dean } [ Harlee Dean ]It would be fair to suggest the { Kuwaiti } [ Kuwait ] owner is not a patient man. { Stuart Pearce } [ Stuart Pearce ] is the fifth manager since the { Al Hasawi } [ Al Hasawi ] family bought the club two years ago and four of those have been since { Fawaz } [ Fawaz Al Hasawi ] replaced cousin { Omar } [ Omar Al Hasawi ].The 10-match unbeaten start seems a long time ago now.

He arrived for the second half as the { manager } [ Manager (association football) ] threw everything into a fight back which imploded with the penalty decision.But it is a leakage rate of 12 goals in five games before Wednesday night which needs addressing urgently.There was plenty of decent, threatening build-up play from { Forest } [ Nottingham Forest F.C. ] without very much of an end product while every time { Brentford } [ Brentford F.C. ] broke, panic.Mark Warburtons players have not been good travellers, three out of four away defeats before last night although they would have been buoyed by beating high-flying Derby last weekend.The opening goal was all down to { Odubajos } [ Deportivo Odubajos ] surging run. Referee { Mark Haywood } [ Mark Haywood ] was spared the decision of whether { Lascelles } [ Paul Lascelles ] block was a penalty as both players tumbled to the turf because the ball squirted to { Toral } [ Juan Toral ], who scored.Day Fox was taken off on a stretcher to leave { Forest } [ Nottingham Forest F.C. ] down to 10 menForest responded positively without forcing { David Button } [ David Button ] into any real saves until the latter stages. He could do nothing when { Antonio } [ Antonio (The Merchant of Venice) ] let fly.But { Pearces } [ Peter Pearces ] team always looked vulnerable on the break. Interestingly Lascelles was sacrificed in the half-time reshuffle with { Michael Manciee } [ Michael Manciee ] dropping into the back four from midfield.By that time, { Lichaj } [ Vladim\u00edr \u0160l\u0105aj ] had tapped the ball into { Grays } [ Grays ] path making the task almost impossible. The ex- {Aston Villa } [ Aston Villa F.C. ] player hung his head and was roundly booed but showed character to keep battling.Any hopes of a comeback were dashed with { Wilsons } [ Alan Wilsons ] challenge on { Gray } [ Lee Gray (footballer) ]  a stonewall penalty.To the { fans } [ Fan (person) ] credit, many stayed until the end. To the players credit, they kept probing and did score.Stuart Pearce finds himself under increasing pressure from { Nottingham Forest } [ Nottingham Forest F.C. ]'s { Kuwaiti } [ Kuwait ] ownersBut this will go down as a very bad night at the office for Pearce, and, by extension, { Al Hasawi } [ Al Hasawi SC ].

You always look to make one or two changes but they are in need of quite a few players. Sam Allardyce is talking about new signings at { West Ham } [ West Ham United F.C. ] and you wonder if { Neil Warnock } [ Neil Warnock ] will do something at { Crystal Palace } [ Crystal Palace F.C. ] because they need to get cracking. But { Tony Pulis } [ Tony Pulis ] left as a result of their transfer policy so it will be interesting to see what happens here. But you have to invest to stay in this league and every { manager } [ Manager (association football) ] will probably still be hoping to squeeze in a few more deals between now and Monday.I think it was a good signing and I think there was a real momentum at { Anfield } [ Anfield ] last year with the emotion and belief they had. Just when they might have been looking at their signings and thinking 'is there one that will catch the imagination', this transfer certainly does. He wasnt quite so good at the { World Cup } [ FIFA World Cup ] but he is clearly a very dangerous. Coming back to { England } [ England ] hell be able to live very close to where he did before and I think he is adored by the fans over here.Before the { season } [ Season (sports) ] started it was probably { Alexis Sanchez } [ Alexis S\u00e1nchez ], but he has not started the { season } [ Season (sports) ] on fire. But in terms of starting well, I think { Gylfi Sigurdsson } [ Gylfi Sigurdsson ] has slotted back in seamlessly at { Swansea } [ Swansea City A.F.C. ] and hes a better player than a lot of people give him credit for. He went from playing at right back to { Southampton } [ Southampton F.C. ], to centre back at { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] and now a call-up for the full { England } [ England national football team ] squad. Its always hard to tell at these early stages but those two have impressed me.Well you talk about { goalkeepers } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ] becoming a third centre half these days to play out from the back  I guess he took it to the next level! { Goalkeepers } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ] are becoming more technically gifted so who knows what will happen in future. I never actually ended up in goal but theres always some player who fancies himself as a { goalkeeper } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ] {. } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ] In training wed play a lot of small-sided games so one { goalkeeper } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ] would be there and then a player might join in, but these days thats rare with so many top { goalkeepers } [ Goalkeeper (association football) ] in squads. The odd player might go in goal for shooting practice  they always enjoy diving and think they can do better than the keeper!I played against { Grobbelaar } [ Edwin Grobbelaar ] and he was lovely off the field  he was nothing like what you saw on it. He used to give plenty to his defenders if he thought they were at fault but he was a real character and you have to admire goalkeepers who try something a little bit different to put the opposition off.You always see something like that as a great challenge. You would welcome him to the { Premier League } [ Premier League ] and I'd certainly let him know that even if I was playing for an unfashionable club and was a lesser known player, he'd certainly know about me by the end of 90 minutes! What it does do is make you play at your absolute best. He will raise the quality of those around him in his team but as the opposition you try a bit harder and you're more conscious of getting tight to him, even if that means getting quite physical. I'd be getting the first chance to impact on him so I don't want this to be a game thinking he's done especially well on his debut!I think a lot of the criticism of Sir { Alex Ferguson } [ Alex Ferguson ] has been harsh. He brought such success to the club and also brought in players who he thought would succeed right until the end. Even when he bought { Robin van Persie } [ Robin van Persie ] and people suspected it might be the end, he won the league. But when you look at the likes of { Smalling } [ Lee Smalling ] and { Jones } [ Lee Jones (footballer) ], I don't think they were quite nurtured in the same way as { Vidic } [ Vladim\u00edr \u0160idovi\u0107 ] and { Ferdinand } [ Paul Ferdinand ] were. Those two are now almost a problem for the club because they havent trained on and done as well as expected  if they had you would say it's good management by Ferguson. But they have not developed. I do think the one area where { Ferguson } [ Ferguson ] was guilty of not securing the future was in { midfield } [ Midfield ] {. } [ Midfielder ] He relied so heavily on { Paul Scholes } [ Paul Scholes ] and maybe he should have got the cheque book out sooner.I certainly think he can be. He brings a different set of problems for the opposition to cope with. He's got phenomenal pace. I don't think I've ever seen anyone with the same tenacity to win the ball back for his team. That work rate he has, you see more of that in central positions than out wide. { When } [ When (song) ] he gets the ball and links with team-mates {, } [ When (song) ] sometimes he needs to slow things down a bit { and } [ When (song) ] think things through {. } [ When (song) ] When you look at someone like { Thierry Henry } [ Thierry Henry ] {, } [ Thierry Henry ] he wasn't involved as often {, } [ Thierry Henry ] but he picked and chose his moments to make a telling contribution {. } [ Thierry Henry ] I think that's what { Sanchez } [ Sanchez (baseball) ] has to do if he plays through the { middle } [ Middle (gridiron football) ] {. } [ Middle (gridiron football) ] But the { fans } [ Fan (person) ] love him because of his willingness to run and to take on much bigger men  you can't bully him.Really good question! Looking at the players there is such an uncertainty in their play. If you're on the training pitch every day and there is only one lone voice talking you through the system, you dont really take ownership of it. Certainly out of position they don't seem to know where they are supposed to be on the { pitch } [ Football pitch ] and it looks like theres almost an { information overload } [ Information overload ]. Sometimes the { players } [ Football player ] need to make the decisions for themselves, but playing that { system } [ System ] is not coming naturally to them. The overall philosophy and method of learning is not working, but they have bought a new { defender } [ Defender (association football) ] in { Marcos Rojo } [ Marcos Rojo ] so I think they will be looking at a central { midfielder } [ Midfielder ]. But you can't keep buying your way out of trouble and maybe even { Rooney } [ Rooney ] can come into { midfield } [ Midfielder ] as a creative option. But with { Javier Hernandez } [ Javier Hern\u00e1ndez ] losing his golden touch and { Day Welbeck } [ Day Welbeck ] being told he can go, they might also need a striker with genuine pace at this rate!One hundred per cent no! But it does show you if you don't know where to be on a pitch, it doesn't matter how quick or mobile you are, you're not going to make it. I have some sympathy with { Chris Smalling } [ Chris Smalling ] and { Phil Jones } [ Phil Jones (footballer) ] who have been moved from pillar to post at { United } [ Manchester United F.C. ] and they dont look like serious first team contenders. I might know where to be at the pitch and be able to read the game, but I'm not sure I'd have the athleticism to cope! {Roy } [ Roy (footballer) ] has clearly had so few options that he's had to turn to the youth. I'm pleased to see { Andros Townsend } [ Andros Townsend ] back but it seesm that if you are in the team for a top four team - like { Calum Chambers } [ Calum Chambers ] - you get straight in the { England } [ England ] squad. It might be early for him to get in there but when you look at the other options, there aren't many! { Roy } [ Roy Evans (footballer) ] is probably looking at players who have a good chance of featuring over the next two years. It's very early in their club careers for the likes of { Chambers } [ Lee Chambers ] and { John Stones } [ John Stones ] but there are not many players out there and they will be a part of { England } [ England ]'s future. I think { Chambers } [ Robert Chambers (footballer) ] or { Stones } [ Lee Stones ] could even end up playing at right back as utility men, which is indicative of where we are but I was surprised than { Nathaniel Clyne } [ Nathaniel Clyne ] did not make it in there. Roy also has to look at some new candidates in midfield. Maybe it's time for { Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain } [ Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ] to claim that central position he covets or maybe { James Milner } [ James Milner ] would be a safe pair of hands in there.I think it has to be one of the proudest moments of any { Englishman } [ England ] {'s } [ England ] career, both for { him } [ England national football team ] and his whole { family } [ Family ]. He was the obvious candidate among an inexperienced squad - you've lost three players with more than 100 caps in the last 12 months. I haven't been in his compnay behind the scenes but I think he's a very visual captain leading by example but he has to be wary overdoing that. He will need help from both { Louis van Gaal } [ Louis van Gaal ] at { Manchester United } [ Manchester United F.C. ] and { Roy Hodgson } [ Roy Hodgson ] in dealing with that. He's certainly maturing with his discipline but you don't want to take anything away from his game and he needs to find that balance and I'm sure he can do it.They're good players but I think the question is where do they play? { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ] are very settled as a team. Maybe if they had made the { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] { Kagawa } [ Kagawa FC ] might have been a good option, particularly with { Ross Barkley } [ Ross Barkley ] out. But I'm not sure about { Holtby } [ Paul Holtby ] {, } [ Paul Holtby ] I don't think he's progressed as he migth have liked. Both have also suffered a loss of form, so I don't know. I thought I'd see more from { Kagawa } [ Masami Kagawa ] at the { World Cup } [ 1998 FIFA World Cup ] but he seems to have gone backwards as a player.and welcome to this week's Tackle Keown.Martin is answering your questions about all the big issues, so stay tuned.Its not too late to play { MailOnline } [ MailOnline ] Fantasy Football Theres xc2xa31,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager\"."}, {"dailymail/training/649efefb302cf3f9cf6ecdb042382b174d38c6ac": "Identified: Grant Adamson, 55, descendant of one of the founding families of { Malibu } [ Malibu, California ], died in a ballooning accident in { Switzerland } [ Switzerland ]Grant Adamson, a { Pepperdine University } [ Pepperdine University ] supporter and descendant of a founding family of { Malibu } [ Malibu, California ], has been identified as the { American } [ United States ] tourist who was killed in a hot air balloon accident in { Switzerland } [ Switzerland ] Tuesday.Pepperdine Vice Dean Shelley Saxer said the school is deeply saddened by Adamson's passing at age 55, and the serious injuries sustained by his wife, Terry, and their daughters, Lauren and Megan.Swiss police said the { hot air balloon } [ Hot air balloon ] carrying Adamson and family crashed into an { electric power line } [ Electric power transmission ] while trying to land after a two-hour flight Tuesday morning.The { balloon } [ Balloon ] fell 165 feet in the crash.

their fourth home defeat of the campaignJoe LewisTottenham's owner may be a billionaire but he hasn't exactly dipped deep into his pockets to help the club elevate from the also-rans into { Premier League } [ Premier League ] title contenders.That may seem a crazy statement considering { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] have had summer transfer windows reaching over xc2xa3100m in expenditure, and they have consistently over the last five years been one of the biggest spenders in the top flight.Joe Lewis hold { Daniel Levy } [ Daniel Levy (footballer) ]'s arm as he watches on during { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ]'s 3-0 defeat by { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] earlier this season in the { Premier League } [ Premier League ]But they have also raised plenty of funds through player sales, and as a result are bottom of the table of { Premier League } [ Premier League ] net spenders over the last five years in comparison with every other top flight club.Lewis was also on board with the decision to part company with { Harry Redknapp } [ Harry Redknapp ] over two years ago.Blame rating 3/5Daniel LevyAn increasing number of fans are losing patience with Levy, who has come under criticism for a range of issues including manager choices, stadium development and clus managerial set-up.The { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] chairman has successfully overseen a project to build one of the most impressive training grounds in { Europe } [ Europe ] at { Hotspur Way } [ Hotspur Way ], but his track record elsewhere is questionable.Levy has come under fire regarding the handling of a new stadium and his managerial appointments {George Graham } [ George Graham (footballer) ] (1998-2001) {Gle Hoddle } [ Glenn Hoddle ] (2001-2003) {David Pleat } [ David Pleat ] (2003-2004) {Jacques Santini } [ Jacques Santini ] (2004) {Martin Jol } [ Martin Jol ] (2004-2007) {Juande Ramos } [ Juande Ramos ] (2007-2008) {Harry Redknapp } [ Harry Redknapp ] (2008-2012) {Andre Villas-Boas } [ Andre Villas-Boas ] (2012-2013) {Tim Sherwood } [ Tim Sherwood ] (2013-2014) {Mauricio Pochettino } [ Mauricio Pochettino ] (2014- present)Having gone through 10 managers since taking over in 2001, no consistency is ever put down at the club and during that time Levy has favoured a continental approach of using a head coach and a director of football.It's a { system } [ System ] that's never worked. { Harry Redknapp } [ Harry Redknapp ]'s tenure that took { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] to { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] football was a desperate breakaway from the format, with the current { QPR } [ Queens Park Rangers F.C. ] boss having been originally brought in to clear up the mess left behind by { Juande Ramos } [ Juande Ramos ] and { Damien Comolli } [ Damien Comolli ] in 2008.A lack of discussion with fans over a controversial move to { Stratford } [ Stratford, London ]'s { Olympic Stadium } [ Olympic Stadium (Stratford) ] (which failed) and constant delays over the build of the new stadium has made the club look amateurish in plaing its future home - especially regarding the temporary move to { Milton Keynes } [ Milton Keynes ] {. } [ Milton Keynes ]Meanwhile long suffering fans are paying the second highest ticket prices in the league, with a partnership with ticketing site { Stubhub } [ StubHub ] also alienating sections of supporters.With the club in regression, many see { Levy } [ Harry Levy ] is a constant presence in every false dawn making him accountable to many fans over { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ]'s current plight.Blame rating 5/5Franco BaldiniRecruited as director of football in 2013 to 'assist' { Andre Villas-Boas } [ Andre Villas-Boas ] with transfers after { Redknapp } [ Glenn Redknapp ]'s managerial replacement had guided the club to their biggest ever { Premier League } [ Premier League ] points haul the season before.His challenge was to reinvest the money collected from { Gareth Bale } [ Gareth Bale ] {'s } [ Gareth Bale ] record xc2xa386million transfer to { Real Madrid } [ Real Madrid C.F. ] and bring in a raft of replacements to make { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] an overall stronger squad.Seven high profile signings and a little over a year later, all { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] have to show for the xc2xa3100m-plus spend-up is a fairly positive season from { Christian Eriksen } [ Christian Eriksen ] (who has faded badly this term), and a rather decent rabona goal from { Erik Lamela } [ Erik Lamela ] (who has done little else as the clus xc2xa330million record signing.)Before joining Tottenham, Franco Baldini (left) was an assistant to { Fabio Capello } [ Fabio Capello ] in the { England } [ England ] set-upFrom left to right, { Paulinho } [ Paulinho de Oliveira ], { Christian Eriksen } [ Christian Eriksen ], { Roberto Soldado } [ Roberto Soldado ], { Nacer Chadli } [ Nacer Chadli ], { Etiee Capoue } [ \u00c9tiee Capoue ], { Vlad Chiriches } [ Vlad Chiriches ] and { Erik Lamela } [ Erik Lamela ] were the seven players signed to replace { Gareth Bale } [ Gareth Bale ] -

So what's gone wrong?The players appear to be struggling with { Pochettino } [ Argentina national football team ] {'s } [ Argentina national football team ] pressing tactic and the { Argentine } [ Argentina ] is either too stubborn to change it or lacking a { Plan B } [ Plan B (football) ] for his confidence-shot team.Mauricio { Pochettino } [ Mauricio Pochettino ] looks on during { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ]'s { League Cup } [ EFL Cup ] fourth round win over { Brighton } [ Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. ] earlier this season, the cup competitions have been the { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] boss's highlights in a slow start at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ]The constant changing of starting line-ups suggest he still doesn't know his best XI and if he did have a say in summer transfers, he appears to already have lost faith in all three of his signings who have hardly featured.With a team very similar to last season's, { Pochettino } [hettino ]'s side are already six points off { Villas-Boas } [ Villas-Boas ]' { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] outfit.Moreworryinglywill be the level of performances. Tottenham have already been rolled over with ease by { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ], { Newcastle } [ Newcastle United F.C. ] and { West Brom } [ West Bromwich Albion F.C. ], while relative big guns { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] and { Manchester City } [ Manchester City F.C. ] have already stuck seven goals past Spurs this term.The Argentinedeservesmore time to lay his blueprint on the squad however - especially with the team progressing well in { Europe } [ Europe ] and the { League Cup } [ League Cup ]. So when it does happen, { fans } [ Fan (person) ] can point blame towards tight { refereeing } [ Referee (association football) ] calls, ways the { team } [ Team ] can learn from mistakes or just flat out settle that luck went against them.But on many occasions this { season } [ 2012\u201313 in English football ] {, } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] fans have been left with none of the above three to call upon.Tottenham have lost games showing very little (if any) danger in attack while throwing up a circus of a back four on many occasions. Even the league wins areunconvincing, with the 4-0 home win over { QPR } [ Queens Park Rangers F.C. ] the onlytime Spurs have looked relatively comfortable playing in the top flight all season (draws at { Sunderland } [ Sunderland A.F.C. ] and { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] aside).Kane and { Nacer Chadli } [ Nacer Chadli ] share a discussion on the pitch during the 2-1 loss by { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ] at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] {Emmanuel Adebayor } [ Emmanuel Adebayor ] infuriated fans after being unprepared to come on as a substitute against { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ] on Sunday after being forced to change his footwearConsidering the money spent on much of the first-team, it's a rather poor return from the current squad.But with a team containing fingerprints from six previous { Spurs } [ San Antonio Spurs ] managers, it's little wonder that the current crop have failed to settle into a cohesive unit.Another pressing issue is the departure of long term stalwarts and characters in recent years such as { Ledley King } [ Ledley King ] and { Michael Dawson } [ Michael Dawson (footballer) ], leaving { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] with very few leaders on the pitch.Blame rating 3/5The fans {Emmanuel Adebayor } [ Emmanuel Adebayor ] may have whipped up a frenzy in speaking about the negative atmosphere inside { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] provided by the home support, but he isn't the first to point the finger of blame at the { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] fans.Andre { Villas-Boas } [ Andre Villas-Boas ] made a similar remark in the last few months of his reign of how he felt the fans were hindering rather than supporting his players with booing at matches.It's a touchy subject, with supporters arguing that having paid for a ticket they have a right to voice their displeasure and that it's up to the players to give them something to cheer about.Tottenham fans have been criticised by { Adebayor } [ Adebayor (footballer) ] and { Andre Villas-Boas } [ Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas ] before over their negative impact at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] having often turned on their team with a chorus of boos when the home side are strugglingIt makes the opposition's team-talk a lot easier though when you know a fast start at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] will quickly lead to home fans getting on their side's backs.Adebayor and { AVB } [ AVB Basket ] seem to make valid points though, with booing hardly a strong motivational tool to help get behind a struggling team.But to blame a section of { supporters } [ Fan (person) ] for a { team } [ Team ]'s plight is quite drastic. Tottenham's home fans need to show more patience and support for the benefit of their side but neither are they the cause of the problem.Blame rating 1/5Previous managersA rot started under { Harry Redknapp } [ Harry Redknapp ] when his team went on a disastrous run at the end of the { 2011-12 } [ 2011\u201312 in English football ] campaign to throw away a { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] place, but the bounce back the following season under { Andre Villas-Boas } [ Andre Villas-Boas ] makes { Redknapp } [ Harry Redknapp ] unaccountable for current events.Blame rating 0/5Replacing { Redknapp } [ Glenn Redknapp ], was { Andre Villas-Boas } [ Andre Villas-Boas ] and while { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] recorded their most ever points in a { Premier League } [ Premier League ] season under AVB - many point towards { Gareth Bale } [ Gareth Bale ] as the key reason behind their challenge for a { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] place in 2012/13.Harry Redknapp, { Andre Villas-Boas } [ Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas ] and { Tim Sherwood } [ Tim Sherwood ] have had managerail spells since 2012 at TottenhamAfter Bale's departure, Spurs struggled to score and started suffering humiliating defeats by { Manchester City } [ Manchester City F.C. ] (6-0) and { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] (5-0) leading to the Portuguese' in December last year. The { team } [ Team ]'s now fragile mentality hasn't recovered.Blame rating 2/5 {Tim Sherwood } [ Tim Sherwood ] was brought in to replace { Villas-Boas } [ Villas-Boas ] shortly before { Christmas } [ Christmas ] last year, but while { Spurs } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] often beat teams below them in the table, they were often heavily defeated by the division's best outfits. Sherwood promoted youngsters like { Harry Kane } [ Harry Kane ] and { Nabil Bentaleb } [ Nabil Bentaleb ] into the line-up but his honest attitude failed to install a team ethic in the squad and he was dismissed as { manager } [ Manager (association football) ] in the summer.Pochettino has  described { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] {'s } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] pitch as being too

Build a partnership with { Jos } [ Jos cricket team ] tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once.My movements are very good at the minute. You go through blips in your career and the key now for me is to score as many as I can while I have this going for me.While { Root } [ Dominic Root ] was the star of the day, this was hardly a failure for an { England } [ England cricket team ] captain who has now made four scores of 70-plus in his last seven { Test } [ Test cricket ] iings, but { Cook } [ Ian Cook ] would have given anything to have been able to add those extra, elusive 24 runs. The brutal reality is that only { Mike Brearley } [ Mike Brearley ] among { England } [ England cricket team ] captains and opening batsmen has gone longer without a hundred than { Cooks } [ James Cook ] 34 iings and he had the advantage of being considered the best leader of them all.It is now 697 days since { Cook } [ James Cook ] made the last of his record 25 Test centuries, at { Headingley } [ Headingley Stadium ] against { New Zealand } [ New Zealand national cricket team ] way back in 2013 when everything seemed well with the world of { England } [ England cricket team ] and their captain.Here { Cook } [ Alec Cook ] and { Trott } [ Ian Trott ] recorded { Englands } [ England cricket team ] first century opening partnership for 31 iings as { England } [ England ] went about their quest for a decisive lead in workmanlike fashion on a slow pitch and an even slower outfield. The second-slowest half-century of { Trotts } [ Lancashire County Cricket Club ] career, which was reached off 137 balls, was also one of the most important for a man who was in almost as great a need of runs as { Cook } [ Alec Cook ] after his double failure in { Antigua } [ Antigua ] {. } [ Antigua ]If { Trotts } [ Alec Trotts ] wicket came almost out of the blue when he drove the leg-spin of { Bishoo } [ Ali Bishoo ] to second slip then { Cook } [ James Cook ] seemed sure to make this the day when he finally threw off any doubts about him at the helm for another { Ashes } [ The Ashes ].Not only had he been dropped on 29 on the second evening but  he survived an lbw shout on 65 on Thursday by a whisker when the deserving { Bishoo } [ Ali Bishoo ] saw his review of { Steve Davis } [ Steve Davis (cricketer) ] not out decision deemed umpires call.Just when { Cook } [ Ian Cook ] was looking at his best after lunch, { Shaon Gabriel } [ Shaon Gabriel ] went round the wicket, bowled short and wide and somehow forced { Cook } [ Ian Cook ] to inside edge an attempted cut into his stumps.He stood for a moment, hunched over his bat, before trudging off with a score worth perhaps 20 more because of the slowness of the outfield but one that to { Cook } [ Ian Cook ] will seem not nearly enough.Trott summed up the mood of frustration, saying: { Alastair } [ Alastair Campbell (cricketer) ] and I were really pleased to put on a good start but you dont spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties, you go there to get match-defining hundreds.When { Ian Bell } [ Ian Bell ] also chopped on to { Gabriel } [ Andy Gabriel ], a sure sign of a slow surface, { West Indies } [ West Indies cricket team ] were back in the match and { Englands } [ England cricket team ] nerves were starting to fray. Yet that was to underestimate the extraordinary potential of the two exciting and prolific young { Yorkshire } [ Yorkshire ] batsmen in { Englands } [ England ] middle order.The lack of touch and confidence that { Gary Ballance } [ Gary Ballance ] displayed in the { World Cup } [ Cricket World Cup ] now looks light years away as he has returned to the { Test } [ Test cricket ] form that made him the { ICCs } [ International Cricket Council ] emerging player of 2014. { Ballance } [ Alec Ballance ] made 122 in { Antigua } [ Antigua ] and carried on here, bringing an urgency to { Englands } [ England ] iings that was lacking when they managed just 69 runs in an extended morning session.Cook stands and waits for the result of a { West Indies } [ West Indies ] decision review after an LBW appeal was judged not out by the on-field umpireCook is lucky the umpire gave him not out initially after the ball pitched outside off and hit in line but was only just clipping the stumpsCook hits aggressively behind square as { Blackwood } [ Ian Blackwood ] braces himself at the National Cricket StadiumCook checks on the welfare of { Blackwood } [ Ian Blackwood ] after his well-hit pull shot struck the close-in fielderWest Indies bowler { Gabriel } [ Gabriel ] is a blur as he comes into his delivery stride on day three of the second TestCook's off stump is rattled and the bails fly off after a wide delivery from { Gabriel } [ Gabriel ] found the skipper's inside edge {Gabriel } [ Gabriel ] and his team-mates celebrate as Cook leans on his bat in disappointment after being dismissed for 76Cook trudges off the field after a solid iings that ultimately fell short of an elusive hundred for the left-handed openerBut if { Ballance } [ Dominic Ballance ] was busy then { Root } [ Root (cricketer) ] roistered along, reaching 50 off 69 balls and 100 off 125. He has been a class apart almost from the moment { England } [ England cricket team ] recalled him, after leaving him out of the last { Test } [ Test cricket ] of their { Ashes } [ The Ashes ] humiliation, and restored him to the { middle order } [ Batting order (cricket) ] where he belongs.This was his { England } [ England cricket team ] record-equalling sixth successive { Test } [ Test cricket ] score of 50 or more, a landmark shared with { Patsy Hendren } [ Patsy Hendren ], { Ted Dexter } [ Ted Dexter ], { Ken Barrington } [ Ken Barrington ] and Cook himself.

particularly A&E, { NHS 111 } [ NHS 111 ] and ambulance services.'In light of the latest weather warnings across the country, we would urge people - particularly the elderly - to stay in the warm, ensure they have proper medication, get their flu jab if they have not yet done so, and seek advice from their pharmacist or their { GPs } [ General practitioner ] for colds, coughs and minor ailments.But an increase of around 6,000 patients from the same week 12 months ago.Of those, 39, 705 people had to wait longer than four hours to be seen, down from 53,681.There were also high levels of emergency admissions, with a total of 105,200 - up 3,400 on the same week last year.The number of patients waiting more than four hours for admission after attending an A&E unit was 11,980, down from 16,324 in the previous week.The latest figures show that on average more than 4,000 { hospital } [ Hospital ] beds a day were occupied by { patients } [ Patient ] whose discharge was delayed, the highest point this year and worse than at any point last winter.The { NHS 111 } [ NHS 111 ] service took 255,000 calls for the week ending January 11, down from 323,000 the previous week and a dramatic reduction from the peak of 439,000 for the week ending December 28.Figures released on January 6 revealed from October to December 2014 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target and the longest waits since the target was introducedThe latest weekly figures comes as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published draft guidance for the number of nurses that should be on duty in A&E units.The organisation said there should be enough nursing staff on duty to have one nurse for every four cubicles but two registered nurses to one patient in cases of major trauma or { cardiac arrest } [ Cardiac arrest ],There should also be a registered children's nurse on each shift, or at least one A&E nurse with education and training in children's nursing.Because demand in A&E can change rapidly, the guidelines recommend that departments, in plaing, should allow for enough nursing staff to care for higher than the average number of patients who attend the department on a daily basis.By increasing weekly { nursing } [ Nursing ] staff hours to cover above-average attendance numbers, staff can deal with unexpected peaks in the demand for services and be moved around the department flexibly to respond to changing situations.The chief executive and general secretary of the { Royal College of Nursing } [ Royal College of Nursing ] ( {RCN } [ Royal College of Nursing ]) said thousands more staff should be recruited for A&E departments.Dr Peter Carter told { BBC Radio 4 } [ BBC Radio 4 ] {'s } [ BBC ] { Today } [ Today (BBC Radio 4) ] programme: 'The reality on the ground is even if these guidelines are implemented, which we hope they will be, we are a long way from having the requisite number of staff in many A&E departments.'Not all, but there is certainly a significant number of A&E departments that are woefully short of the requisite number of nursing staff that they currently need.'He added that { RCN } [ Royal College of Nursing ] analysis due to be published shortly will 'demonstrate that you will still need to recruit several thousand nurses across the country in A&E departments' to meet the guidelines, which would inevitably require staff to be brought in from overseas.Professor Mark Baker of { Nice } [ Nice ] said the organisation was 'not absolutely sure at the moment' how many hospitals already complied with the draft guidance.He said that better plaing and 'anticipatory' recruitment would reduce the dependency on agency staff, potentially balancing out any cost to the { NHS } [ National Health Service ].'If you plan to staff your { departments } [ Departmentalization ] at average demand, you will be understaffed half of the time,' he said.'What we are proposing is that { managers } [ Management ] should plan to staff their departments so that they are only short of staff, on the random variation of demands on A&E, one day a week and that will reduce the dependency on { agency } [ Law of agency ] staff.'So even though there will be more staff available, it won't cost the service more.'The target: The { Government } [ Government of the United Kingdom ] wants 95 per cent of patients to be transferred, admitted or discharged within four hours of arriving at accident and emergency departmentsThe challenge: There were 5,573,644 attendances at A&E departments across { England } [ England ] in the October to December 2014 quarter, up from 5,294,269 during the corresponding period in 2013Record-long waits: The four-hour rule was met for 92.6 per cent of { English } [ England ] A&E patients this quarter -

'Therefore we would advise the public to access A&E only if they have life threatening or serious injuries.'Throughout this extremely challenging period we've continued to provide treatment to those patients who really needed { acute } [ Acute (medicine) ], { emergency } [ Emergency medicine ] or { critical care } [ Intensive care medicine ].'Ensuring that level of care was provided could only have been made possible through the commitment and dedication of our staff here at the hospitals and also from our partners across health and social care.

It remains to be seen though how the rest of the season unfolds.Current { Ajax } [ AFC Ajax ] coach { Frank de Boer } [ Frank de Boer ], backed up by former Guers { Deis Bergkamp } [ Deis Bergkamp ] and { Marc Overmars } [ Marc Overmars ] remains an option should the club wish to move in another direction.Since his retirement, Henry has been working as a television pundit for { Sky Sports } [ Sky Sports ] {Edinson Cavani } [ Edinson Cavani ] has been touted as a summer target for { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] in a xc2xa364million deal from { PSG } [ Paris Saint-Germain F.C. ] to make way for the { French } [ France ] club signing { Angel di Maria } [ \u00c1ngel di Maria ] from { Manchester United } [ Manchester United F.C. ].However, { Real Madrid } [ Real Madrid C.F. ] are considering making a move for the { Uruguayan } [ Uruguay ] striker and it would be major shift in policy if { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] paid that sort of fee and the xc2xa3250,000-a-week wages { Cavani } [ Paulo Cavani ] would want.Edinson Cavani has been touted as a summer target for { Arsenal } [ Arsenal F.C. ] should { PSG } [ Paris Saint-Germain F.C. ] sign { Angel di Maria } [ \u00c1ngel di Maria ] {Robert Lewandowski } [ Robert Lewandowski ] has come onto { Manchester United } [ Manchester United F.C. ]s radar in what promises to be another summer of big spending for { Louis van Gaal } [ Louis van Gaal ].The { Polish } [ Poland ] striker joined { Bayern Munich } [ FC Bayern Munich ] from { Borussia Dortmund } [ Borussia Dortmund ] on a { free transfer } [ Free transfer (association football) ] last summer.Eleven goals in 28 games has not been a bad return but the word in { Germany } [ Germany ] is that he hasnt really settled in under { Pep Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ].It seems certain { United } [ Manchester United F.C. ] wont exercise their option to sign { Radamal Falcao } [ Radamal Falcao ] on a permanent basis and { Lewandowski } [ Corey Lewandowski ] would be in ideal addition to bolster their front line especially if he comes on the market around the xc2xa330 million bracket.Bayern Munich striker { Robert Lewandowski } [ Robert Lewandowski ] (left) is a summer transfer target for { Manchester United } [ Manchester United F.C. ]I am hearing {Real Madrid } [ Real Madrid C.F. ] will battle { PSG } [ Paris Saint-Germain F.C. ] for { Tottenhams } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] xc2xa325m-rated goalkeeper { Hugo Lloris } [ Hugo Lloris ] in the summer.I am also hearing {Andy Carroll } [ Andy Carroll ] could be sold by { West Ham } [ West Ham United F.C. ] in the summer, that is if he can prove his fitness to another club.The clubs hierarchy have grown weary of Carrolls terrible injury record since making him their record singing at xc2xa315m 18 months ago following a seasons loan at the club from { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ]I hear { Newcastle } [ Newcastle United F.C. ], who sold { Carroll } [ Lewis Carroll ] to { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] for xc2xa335m, would be willing to take him back but offer as little as xc2xa38 million plus appearance bolt ons. Carroll , sideline to the end of the season with a knee injury ,would also have to consider a wage cut.With the likelyhood that { Sam Allardyce } [ Sam Allardyce ] ,who has so much belief in the player ,will be gone, the club would be ready to get the erratic { England } [ England ] centre forward off their booksCarroll injured his knee but stayed on the pitch after { West Ham } [ West Ham United F.C. ] had made all three of their substitutionsCarroll has posted a picture of his bandaged and swollen knee on his official { Instagram } [ Instagram ] accountiSayQPRs new manager { Chris Ramsey } [ Chris Ramsey (footballer) ] spoke impressively when questioned about the events on the { Paris Metro } [ Paris Metro ] last week.As one of the few { black } [ Black people ] bosses in { English } [ England ] { football } [ Association football ] and who, as a player, started out in the early Eighties when { racism } [ Racism ] was rife, Ramsey, 52, was better qualified than most to take a view on the situation.And { Ramsey } [ Paul Ramsey ] was candid.He went out of his way to stress that those guilty of the abuse were not real { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] supporters and the club itself should not be held responsible even if they had a duty to take the action of baing the fans from { Stamford Bridge } [ Stamford Bridge (stadium) ].What Ramsey wants to see is the authorities in { France } [ France ] and { England } [ England ] take the lead in rounding up the bigots. Quite right.Chris Ramsey spoke out his experiences with { racism } [ Racism ] during his time in { football } [ Association football ]Ramsey stressed it was a social issue which he said has improved markedly over the course of time with { football } [ Association football ] often leading the way.But he warned { racism } [ Racism ] lurks hidden and disguised, often in places where on the face of it all the right { anti-racists } [ Anti-racism ] noises are made but behind closed doors. Which is why the authorities must show the will to pursue the suspects with vigour.The depth and power of { Ramseys } [ Liverpool F.C. ] words suggested he has the mental strength to succeed as a top-flight { manager } [ Manager (association football) ] {. } [ Liverpool F.C. ]In many ways it was the emergence of black players as heroes to kids of all races, players like { Laurie Cuingham } [ Laurie Cuingham ], { Cyrille Regis } [ Cyrille Regis ], { John Barnes } [ John Barnes (footballer) ], { Ian Wright } [ Ian Wright ], { Patrick Vieira } [ Patrick Vieira ], that helped push racists to the edges of the football world.A new wave of { black } [ Black people ] { managers } [ Management ] can only help the cause further.So I just hope things go well for { Ramsey } [ Lee Ramsey ] at { QPR } [ Queens Park Rangers F.C. ] and he shows he can handle to pressures of being a top-flight boss as well as he handled last weeks press conference .And who knows if he does, then in a few years time { Ramsey } [ Lee Ramsey ] could become the { England } [ England ] national teams first { black } [ Black people ] { manager } [ Manager (association football) ].BTW:It was good to catch up with { Trevor Sinclair } [ Trevor Sinclair ] on the phone last week about the reunion he had with some ex- {Blackpool } [ Blackpool F.C. ] stars last week.The former { England } [ England national football team ] { winger } [ Midfielder ] was particularly delighted to see { Jimmy Armfield } [ Jimmy Armfield ] at the function.Jimmy is now 79 but it was great to hear Trevor report that the former { England } [ England ] right back and skipper before { Bobby Moore } [ Bobby Moore ] was in good shape.Jimmy Armfield (right) leads out the { England } [ England ] team  as { Alfredo Di Stefano } [ Alfredo Di Stefano ] leads out the Rest Of The World {Trevor Sinclair } [ Trevor Sinclair ] met up with some of his ex- {Blackpool } [ Blackpool F.C. ] team-mates at a reunionI recalled a conversation I had with Jimmy some years ago when { Steven Gerrard } [ Steven Gerrard ] was breaking through into the { England } [ England ] team.Jimmy felt that { England } [ England national football team ] could actually get the best out of him, and { Frank Lampard } [ Frank Lampard ], by playing { Gerrard } [ Steven Gerrard ] as playmaker at right back or wing back.Really?, I questioned. Armfield went on to point out the brilliance of { Carlos Alberto } [ Carlos Alberto Torres ] as { Brazil } [ Brazil ] right back and captain in 1970 and then { Cafu } [ Cafu ] who won two World Cups in { 1994 } [ 1994 FIFA World Cup ] and { 2002 } [ 2002 FIFA World Cup ].Armfield continued that sometimes in international { football } [ Association football ] the only space to exploit is when coming deep from the flanks and that players must adapt from their club positions to impose themselves in the national side.As { Sinclair } [ Glenn Sinclair ] said, such thinking out of the box is what is often needed to make an international team full of individual stars, wiers. Sadly in { England } [ England ] its not since the days of { Gle Hoddle } [ Glenn Hoddle ] that there has been a manger prepared to do so.iBetLast season { West Ham } [ West Ham United F.C. ] beat { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] three times, twice in the league then at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] in the { Capital One Cup } [ FA Cup ].Spurs beat the { Hammers } [ London Hammers ] on the opening day of the season and it hard not to see a Spurs win at home. { Coral } [ Coral (bookmaker) ] quote 5/6, the draw is 13/5, while a { Hammers } [ London Hammers ] win 7/2.Ravel Morrison (left) scores during { West Ham } [ West Ham United F.C. ]'s 3-0 win against { Tottenham } [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] at { White Hart Lane } [ White Hart Lane ] in October 2013Not surprisingly { Harry Kane } [ Harry Kane ] is 7/2 to score the first goal. But { Diafra Sakho } [ Diafra Sakho ] at 8-1 might be worth a tickle if the { Hammers } [ Hammers F.C. ] start on front foot.A possible treble today then is a Spurs win, with both { Everton } [ Everton F.C. ] vs { Leicester } [ Leicester City F.C. ] and { Southampton } [ Southampton F.C. ] vs { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] to end up as draws.\"."}, {"dailymail/validation/47bba5142a5be567494db984955d10111dc6d0e3": "Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes in { Yemen } [ Yemen ], targeting military installations held by the { Shia } [ Shia Islam ] rebels who swept into the country's south and drove the president to flee by sea.At least 18 { civilians } [ Civilian ] were killed and 24 people injured in the military offensive that started on Thursday, with pictures emerging showing flashing lights and what sounded like { machine gun } [ Machine gun ] fire.Saudi-owned { Al-Arabiya News } [ Al Arabiya ] reported that the kingdom deployed 100 fighter jets, 150,000 soldiers and other navy units as part of the attack,Scroll down for videoYemenis frantically search for survivors under the rubble of houses destroyed by a { Saudi } [ Saudi Arabia ] air strike.

This has been a great { Canadian } [ Canada ] story and mystery and the subject of scientists, historians, writers and singers so I think we really have an important day in mapping the history of our country.'He added: 'Finding the first vessel will no doubt provide the momentum  or wind in our sails  necessary to locate its sister ship and find out even more about what happened to the { Franklin Expeditions } [ Franklin's Expeditions ] crew.'Archeologists have hailed the find as highly significant, saying it is likely that items on board are well preserved and may include the bodies of crew members or photographs of their voyage.HMS Erebus and HMS Terror were heavily-armoured bomb ships, and two years before the mission to the { Northwest Passage } [ Northwest Passage ], they had taken an expedition captained by { James Clark Ross } [ James Clark Ross ] to the { Antarctic } [ Antarctic ].Despite his experience in exploring polar waters, { Ross } [ James Ross (navigator) ] turned down the latest mission, viewing it as too dangerous, so instead the command of { Erebus } [ HMS Erebus (1807) ] passed toSir { John Franklin } [ John Franklin ] with Terror captained by { Francis Crozier } [ Francis Crozier ].The pair departed on their ill-fated expedition from { London } [ London ] in May 1845, and were last seen sailing towards the { Lancaster Sound } [ Lancaster Sound ] by two { whaling } [ Whaling ] ships in July that year. { After } [ Afterlife ] that, they were never seen again.While no one knows for sure exactly what happened to the crew, experts believe the ships were lost in 1848 after they became locked in the ice near { King William Island } [ King William Island ] and that the crews abandoned them in a hopeless bid to reach safety.In 1854, an explorer by the name of John Rae came across an { Inuit } [ Inuit ] who claimed to have met the expedition, and produced a small silver plate with the engraving Sir John Franklin K.C.B. However, the man also told Rae that the { explorers } [ Exploration ] had resorted to { caibalism } [ Cannibalism ] in order to stay alive.Mission: The HMS Terror and Erebus, depicted in { New Zealand } [ New Zealand ] in 1841 in a painting, left, were being led by { British } [ United Kingdom ] Arctic explorer Sir { John Franklin } [ John Franklin ], rightWhat happened to them? Mystery still surrounds exactly what happened to the crew, who are depicted in 1847 depiction by W Turner Smith. { Right } [ Right-hand rule ], some of the tools and equipment they took on their expeditionHunt: Another illustration shows the noonday rest of a search party led by Lieutenant { Frederick Schwatka } [ Frederick Schwatka ] as they search for Sir { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] and his team, circa 1880Eventually an expedition to { King William Island } [ King William Island ], near to where the wreck has now been found, discovered a note written by { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] which revealed that the expedition camped at { Beechy Island } [ Beechy Island ] between 1845-6, the Erebus and Terror then sailed southwards to the entrance of { Victoria Strait } [ Victoria Strait ].The note says { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] died on 11 June 1847, without giving a cause of death, and the command passed onto { Francis Crozier } [ Francis Crozier ].Abandoning their ships on April 22, 1848, 105 survivors led by { Crozier } [ Robert Crozier ] set out toward { Back River } [ Back River (New York) ].After that, historians rely on { Inuit } [ Inuit ] accounts for the fate of the men, and believe that some may have headed back to the stricken ships, which sank at different times. It is thought some survivors may have lived as late as 1850.The failure of the expedition was a huge event in { England } [ England ] in the mid-19th century; {The Globe and Mail } [ The Globe and Mail ] likened it to a moon landing gone wrong today.Franklin's vessels are among the most sought-after prizes in marine archaeology, and Harper said the discovery would shed light on what happened to Franklin's crew.Tantalizing traces have been found over the years, including the bodies of three crewmen discovered in the 1980s.The bodies of two { English } [ England ] seamen - John Hartnell, 25, and Royal Marine William Braine, 33 - were exhumed in 1986. An expedition uncovered the perfectly preserved remains of a { petty officer } [ Petty officer ], John Torrington, 20, in an ice-filled coffin in 1984.Franklin's disappearance prompted one of history's largest and longest rescue searches, from 1848 to 1859, which resulted in the passage's discovery. The original search for the ships helped open up parts of the { Canadian } [ Canada ] { Arctic } [ Arctic ] for discovery back in the 1850s.The route runs from the { Atlantic } [ Atlantic Ocean ] to the { Pacific } [ Pacific Ocean ] through the { Arctic } [ Arctic ] archipelago.Search: An image from August 24 shows a crew member of the { HMCS Kingston } [ HMCS Kingston ] loading an remote underwater vehicle as part of the Victoria Strait ExpeditionProud: Prime Minister { Stephen Harper } [ Stephen Harper ], right, talks about the find from the Victoria Strait Expedition as { Parks Canada } [ Parks Canada ]'s Ryan Harris looks on. { Canada } [ Canada ] started looking for the ships in 2008 in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the { Northwest Passage } [ Northwest Passage ], which { Franklin } [ John Franklin ]'s crews had been searching forRecognizable: { Parks Canada } [ Parks Canada ]'s Ryan Harris explains the find from the Victoria Strait Expedition during a a news conference in { Ottawa } [ Ottawa ] on TuesdayEarly clues: John Geiger, president of the { Royal Canadian Geographical Society } [ Royal Canadian Geographical Society ], holds an iron fitting from a { Royal Navy } [ Royal Navy ] ship, which is regarded as the key piece of evidence that led to the discovery of the shipWith the melting { Arctic } [ Arctic ] ice now unlocking the shipping route { Franklin } [ John Franklin ] was after, { Harper } [ Stephen Harper ]'s government searched for the ship in order to stake a claim on the passage.Sunday's discovery came shortly after a team of { archaeologists } [ Archaeology ] found a tiny fragment from the { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] expedition. Searchers discovered an iron fitting that once helped support a boat from one of the doomed expedition's ships in the { King William Island } [ King William Island ] search area.The search for an { Arctic } [ Arctic ] passage to { Asia } [ Asia ] frustrated explorers for centuries, begiing with { John Cabot } [ John Cabot ]'s voyage in 1497. Eventually it became clear that a passage did exist, but was too far north for practical use.Cabot, the { Italian-British } [ Italian British ] explorer, died in 1498 while trying to find it and the shortcut eluded other famous explorers including { Henry Hudson } [ Henry Hudson ] and { Francis Drake } [ Francis Drake ]. No sea crossing was successful until { Roald Amundsen } [ Roald Amundsen ] of { Norway } [ Norway ] completed his trip from 1903-1906.The { HMS Erebus } [ HMS Erebus (1826) ] which sank in the { Victoria Strait } [ Victoria Strait ] along with the { HMS Terror } [ HMS Terror (1813) ] after an ill-fated expedition to find the { Northwest Passage } [ Northwest Passage ]In May 1845 Captain Sir { John Franklin } [ John Franklin ] set off from { London } [ London ] to find the { Northwest Passage } [ Northwest Passage ], a rumoured trading route which { European } [ Europe ] merchants hoped would cut shipping times to { Asia } [ Asia ].Sailing on board the { HMS Erebus } [ HMS Erebus (1789) ] and { HMS Terror } [ HMS Terror (1789) ], along with 129 hand-picked crew and enough supplies to last seven years, { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] sailed north to { Baffin Bay } [ Baffin Bay ], between { Greenland } [ Greenland ] and { Canada } [ Canada ], before turning into { Lancaster Sound } [ Lancaster Sound ].In July 1845 two { whaling } [ Whaling ] vessels recorded spotting { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] and his ships as they sailed past. That was to be the last sighting of either vessel for nearly 160 years.Back in { London } [ London ], in 1847, after months without contact from Franklin, another { Arctic } [ Arctic ] explorer by the name of { James Clark Ross } [ James Clark Ross ] raised the alarm, saying a search party should be sent to look for them.However, believing the boats had enough supplies to last another year at least, the { Navy } [ United States Navy ] delayed sending a search party until 1848.No trace of the boats or their crews could be found, despite a xc2xa320,000 reward being offered for any captain who brought back news of the ill-fate expedition. It wasn't until 1850 that a camp at Beechy Island was discovered, though there was no note explaining where the boats had gone.Later, in 1854, explorer { John Rae } [ John Rae (explorer) ] came across an { Inuit } [ Inuit ] who claimed to have passed the vessels as they were dragged along by their crew, and produced a silver plate with { Franlink } [ John Franlink ]'s initials engraved on it as proof.However, the man also said that he had seen the crews resorting to { caibalism } [ Caibalism ] in order to survive, a claim that is still hotly debated.Finally in 1857 { Captain } [ Captain (armed forces) ] F.L. McClintock, sailing on a mission funded by { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ]'s wife, discovered the remains of a camp on { William Island } [ William Island (Alaska) ], along with a note detailing the last movements of { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] and his crew.The note, which had originally be written saying everything was going well, was peed over with a message revealing how everything had gone wrong.After spending the winter from 1845-6 at a camp on { Beechy Island } [ Beechy Island ], { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] sailed his ships south towards { Victoria Strait } [ Victoria Strait ] before becoming stuck in ice north of { King William Island } [ King William Island ] where the crew spent two winters between September 1846 and April 1848.According to the note, { Franklin } [ Benjamin Franklin ] died on11 June 1847, though no cause is given. The command passed to { Francis Crozier } [ Francis Crozier ], who waited until22 April 1848 before taking 105 survivors and heading for the mainland.Nothing more is known about { Crozier } [ Robert Crozier ], or what became of the men, though it is thought that several may have returned to the ships and lived there until 1850, before the vessels sank to the bottom of the sea.\"."}, {"dailymail/training/41bdcec99c938e82709b31ae6263dcfe0d521d25": "Taylor Swift has won hundreds of awards, but she'll likely never forget her 2009 { Best Female Video } [ MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video ] at the { MTV Video Music Awards } [ MTV Video Music Award ] {. } [ MTV Video Music Award ]Rapper { Kanye West } [ Kanye West ] rushed the stage, stealing the microphone from the unsuspecting singer and insisting fellow nominee { Beyonce } [ Beyonc\u00e9 ] had 'one of the best videos of all time.'However, six years later the two seemed chummy as they posed backstage at the { 57th } [ 57th Annual Grammy Awards ] { Grammy Awards } [ Grammy Award ] in { Los Angeles } [ Los Angeles ] {. } [ Los Angeles ]Scroll down for videoReconciled: It looks like all is good between { Kanye West } [ Kanye West ] (L) and { Taylor Swift } [ Taylor Swift ] (R) after the former infamously interrupted the singer's { MTV VMA } [ MTV Video Music Award ] acceptance speechBad Blood: { Taylor } [ Taylor Swift ] was taken by surprise when { Kanye } [ Kanye West ] rushed the stage back in 2009 when she won { Best Female Video } [ MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video ]In one shot, the unlikely duo appear to be engaged in a handshake, as they both sport wide grins, which is also unusual for { Kanye } [ Kanye West ].The pair were also spotted posing together, standing close as both sported large smiles for the cameras.This comes as a surprise after the shocking interruption that threw off the { Blank Space } [ Blank Space ] singer's 2009 { VMA } [ MTV Video Music Award ] acceptance speech.Playful: { Taylor } [ Taylor Swift ] and { Kanye } [ Kanye West ] sported wide grins as they shook hands at the { 57th Grammy Awards } [ 57th Annual Grammy Awards ] on SundayBury the hatchet?

I called { Chelseas } [ Chelseas ] behaviour disgraceful and sad as they pursued a { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] quarter-final place.They went beyond what is acceptable but, unfortunately, it is not the first time we have seen them do it. I doubt it will be the last, either.Mourinho and his teams take wiing to a level that other teams and managers do not.Mourinho shakes hands with fans before the start of last summer's Soccer Aid match at { Old Trafford } [ Old Trafford ] {Jamie Carragher } [ Jamie Carragher ] (centre) played for { Sam Allardyce } [ Sam Allardyce ]'s { England } [ England ] side for the charity game in June last yearAs the seconds dwindled, { James McEvoy } [ James McEvoy ] (left) went down with an injury as the the Rest of the World won 4-2Respect for Mourinhos achievements in the game is beyond doubt. { In } [ Inch ] a few years from now, we could be acknowledging him as the most successful { manager } [ Manager (association football) ] of all time {, } [ Liverpool F.C. ] particularly if he keeps picking up a trophy every 35 matches {, } [ Liverpool F.C. ] as is his current remarkable ratio {. } [ Liverpool F.C. ]But will he be loved? { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] fans undoubtedly adore him. { Porto } [ F.C. Porto ] and { Inter } [ Inter Milan ] supporters will too. Yet beyond that? It is debatable.Will he care how he is remembered? I think he will. Deep down, I think everyone in { football } [ Association football ] cares how they are perceived.Chelsea players surround { Bjorn Kuipers } [ Bj\u00f8rn Kuipers ] as the Dutch referee gives { Zlatan Ibrahimovic } [ Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 ] his marching ordersIt was this tackle by the Swede on { Oscar } [ Oscar (footballer) ] that had the Chelsea players swarming round the refIbrahimovic's night was over after the tackle in the first halfEvery outfield Chelsea player except { Oscar } [ Oscar (footballer) ] was involved in the mass protestAre trophies more important than creating good memories? I would always argue yes to that. During my career, I won 10 major honours but none of the { Liverpool } [ Liverpool F.C. ] teams I played for is particularly remembered for being a top side.If Im honest, it aoys me, especially when I hear stories even now of how great { Kevin Keegans } [ Kevin Keegans ] { Newcastle } [ Newcastle United F.C. ] team of 1995-96 were or how thrilling the { Leeds } [ Leeds United A.F.C. ] team were that reached the { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] semi-final in 2000. Yes, they both played fast, exciting { football } [ Association football ] but what did they win? Nothing.Mourinho led { Porto } [ F.C. Porto ] to the { UEFA Cup } [ UEFA Europa League ] in 2003 and the { Champions League } [ UEFA Champions League ] a year afterMourinho grabs { Marco Materazzi } [ Marco Materazzi ] after guiding { Inter Milan } [ Inter Milan ] to their third { European Cup } [ UEFA Champions League ] in 2010You want to be successful and have a reputation that spans a lifetime, like the { Real Madrid } [ Real Madrid C.F. ] team of the 1950s that { Alfredo di Stefano } [ Alfredo di Stefano ] and { Ferenc Puskas } [ Ferenc Puskas ] inspired to five consecutive { European Cups } [ UEFA Champions League ] or the { Ajax } [ AFC Ajax ] team of { Rinus Michels } [ Rinus Michels ] and { Johan Cruyff } [ Johan Cruyff ] from the 1970s.They took that style on to the { Dutch } [ Netherlands ] national squad. { Cruyff } [ Jordi Cruyff ] once said, how you play is more important than what you win and to some extent, he is right. The { Holland } [ Netherlands ] side from the { 1974 World Cup } [ 1974 FIFA World Cup ], for instance, get spoken about more than the { West German } [ Germany ] squad that actually won it.Personally, I would have rather been a { German } [ Germany ] than in the { Dutch } [ Netherlands ] squad that came up short. The same goes for { Brazil } [ Brazil national football team ] in { 1982 } [ 1982 FIFA World Cup ] {, } [ 1982 FIFA World Cup ] the other great team that captured hearts but failed to conquer the world.Real Madrid's { Raymond Kopa } [ Raymond Kopa ], { Rial } [ Rial ],  { Alfredo Di Stefano } [ Alfredo Di Stefano ], { Ferenc Puskas } [ Ferenc Puskas ] and { Gento } [ Gento Filho ] pose before a game in 1959 {Johan Cruyff } [ Johan Cruyff ] rounds { Argentina } [ Argentina ] keeper { Daniel Carnevali } [ Daniel Carnevali ] before scoring in the 1974 { World Cup } [ FIFA World Cup ] quarter-finalThe great { Brazilian } [ Brazil ] side of 1982 celebrate { Socrates } [ Socrates of S\u00e3o Paulo ]' wonderful equaliser in the 3-2 defeat by wiers { Italy } [ Italy ]I know most of the names of that great squad, as I am sure many do xe2x80x94 { Zico } [ Zico ], { Eder } [ \u00c9der ], { Falcao } [ Paulo Roberto Falcao ], { Socrates } [ Socrates of S\u00e3o Paulo ] xe2x80x94 but what would those men rather have, a wiers medal xe2x80x94 like their compatriots in 1970 xe2x80x94 or just the knowledge that everyone loved the football they played?In an ideal world, you get remembered for wiing with style. The best example I have of that from my childhood was the { AC Milan } [ A.C. Milan ] team of { Ruud Gullit } [ Ruud Gullit ], { Frank Rijkaard } [ Frank Rijkaard ] and { Marco van Basten } [ Marco van Basten ] that was guided by { Arrigo Sacchi } [ Arrigo Sacchi ] in the late 1980s. Their quality in that period was beyond compare and they remain the last side to retain the { European Cup } [ UEFA Champions League ].Pep Guardiolas Barcelona, however, are the team that took style and success to another level all together. They will still be writing books about them in 50 years, such was the swagger with which they won 14 trophies in four extraordinary years.When a { team } [ Team ] wins { silverware } [ Household silver ] with { imagination } [ Imagination ] and { fantasy } [ Fantasy ], it almost seems more special.Mourinho is just as prolific at collecting trophies as { Guardiola } [ Pep Guardiola ] but the brand of { football } [ Association football ] his team play does not compare. That is why, in the long-term, you wont find his teams spoken about like some of the others I have mentioned. { Chelsea } [ Chelsea F.C. ] have been likened to the { Leeds } [ Leeds United A.F.C. ] team from the 1970s but I actually think the way they conducted themselves was worse during Mourinhos first spell in { England } [ England ]. They were prepared to push it further still.Pep Guardiola is thrown by his adoring { Barcelona } [ FC Barcelona ] players after wiing the 2011 Champions LeagueLeeds players surround { Ray Tinkler } [ Ray Tinkler ] after the referee controversially allowed { Jeff Astle } [ Jeff Astle ]'s goal in 1971 {John Terry } [ John Terry ], { John Mikel Obi } [ John Mikel Obi ], { Ashley Cole } [ Ashley Cole ] and { Michael Essien } [ Michael Essien ] get in referee Rob Styles' face in 2007None of that might bother { Mourinho } [ Jos\u00e9 Mourinho ], in the same way it didnt bother { Rafa Benitez } [ Rafa Ben\u00edtez ].Rafa was puzzled by this, so he asked the { journalist } [ Journalist ]: Who scored Spains wiing goal in the 1964 { European Championship } [ UEFA European Championship ]?The reply came: { Marcelino } [ Marcelino Silva Ramos ]. So { Rafa } [ Rafa Carvalho ] then asked, And how did { Spain } [ Spain ] play in the game? to which there was silence.Oscar appeared to be no worse off after Ibrahimovic's midweek tackle as he trained on Friday {Diego Costa } [ Diego Costa ] sat down for a bit of keepy-uppy at { Cobham } [ Cobham F.C. ] as the players prepared for { Southampton } [ Southampton F.C. ]Mourinho keeps a close eye on things as the Blues boss gets his side ready for Sunday's lunchtime kick-offHis point was all that mattered was { Spain } [ Spain ] had won the trophy. Mourinho would clearly understand the logic in that argument.I can see what he means, too. But the idea of wiing at all costs? That is something with which I am not comfortable. But when all is said and done, you want to be remembered and respected for what you achieved.And if Mourinhos teams keep taking things to the brink, the love his achievements should secure is unlikely to ever come.Hughes revival will put big clubs on alertThere is a big game in the { Midlands } [ Midlands ] with { West Bromwich Albion } [ West Bromwich Albion F.C. ] coming up against { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ].Praise for the work of Albions { Tony Pulis } [ Tony Pulis ], the former { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ] boss, shows no sign of dwindling, particularly after he was named manager of the month for February.West Brom are thriving under his guidance and there is little doubt they will be in the { Barclays Premier League } [ Premier League ] next season.But what about { Mark Hughes } [ Mark Hughes (footballer) ], the man who succeeded { Pulis } [ Tony Pulis ] at { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ]? {Tony Pulis } [ Tony Pulis ] won the manager of the month award for February after his fine work at { West Brom } [ West Bromwich Albion F.C. ] {Mark Hughes } [ Mark Hughes (footballer) ] (right) has flown under the radar but has led the Potters to eighth in the { Premier League } [ Premier League ]Without grabbing any headlines, { Hughes } [ Mark Hughes (footballer) ] has impressively manoeuvred { Stoke } [ Stoke City F.C. ] into eighth place in the { Premier League } [ Premier League ] and they have built on their efforts of last season.

Mars ] yet - giving a snapshot of what { Mars } [ Mars ] was like when it had a dynamic surface.The small spherical objects in this image from { Opportunity } [ Opportunity (rover) ] - still scouring the surface of { Mars } [ Mars ] after nearly 10 years on the Red Planet - are tiny mineral-rich nodules, nicknamed 'blueberries' by { NASA } [ NASA ], which are sticking out of the face of a crater.Now the { Opportunity } [ Opportunity (rover) ] has been joined by the { Curiosity } [ Curiosity (rover) ] - but the older brother is still proving its worth, capturing the geological formations which show how { Mars } [ Mars ] was once a wet world with surface water.The 'spherules' are small - only three millimetres across each - and have been magnified for this image, which shows an area only 2.4inches (6 centimeters) across.They appeared on an { outcrop } [ Outcrop ] called 'Kirkwood' in the { Cape York } [ Cape York (crater) ] segment of the western rim of { Endeavour Crater } [ Endeavour (crater) ].4inches (6cms) patch of { outcrop } [ Outcrop ] on the western rim of { Endeavour Crater } [ Endeavour (crater) ] {. } [ Endeavour (crater) ] The individual spherules are up to about three millimeters in diameterThe Microscopic Imager took the ncomponent images during the 3,064th { Martian } [ Mars ] day of { Opportunity } [ Opportunity (rover) ]'s travelsn- September 6th by { Earth } [ Earth ] time.Opportunity discovered spherules at nits landing site more than eight-and-a-half years earlier, and they werenpromptly nicknamed 'blueberries'.They provided important evidence nabout long-ago wet environmental conditions on { Mars } [ Mars ] because researchers nusing { Opportunity } [ Opportunity (rover) ]'s science instruments identified them as concretions nrich in the mineral ' {hematite } [ Heterite ] {', } [ Heterite ] which was deposited by water saturating nthe bedrock.However these spherules are differentn- they do not have the iron-rich composition of the { blueberries } [ Blueberry ] {, } [ Blueberry ] and nalso differ in concentration {, } [ Blueberry ] distribution and structure.Some of the { spherules } [ Spherule ] in this image have been partially eroded away, revealing { concentric } [ Concentric objects ] internal structure.Landscape: { Opportunity } [ Opportunity (rover) ] captured this image of rock fins near { Kirkwood } [ Kirkwood, Lancashire ] in JulyOpportunity's science team plans to nuse the rover for further investigation of these spherules to determine nwhat evidence they can provide about ancient { Martian } [ Mars ] environmental nconditions.Opportunitys principal investigator, { Steve Squyres } [ Steve Squyres ] of { Cornell University } [ Cornell University ], said: 'This is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission.Self-portrait: This picture shows Opportunity casting a shadow on the rim of { Endeavour } [ Endeavour (crater) ] Crater'Kirkwood is chock full of a dense naccumulation of these small spherical objects. We never nhave seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on nMars.'The { Martian } [ Mars ] blueberries found nelsewhere by { Opportunity } [ Opportunity (rover) ] are concretions formed by action of nmineral-laden water inside rocks, evidence of a wet environment on earlynMars.nMany of the { Kirkwood } [ Kirkwood, Lancashire ] { spheres } [ Sphere ] are broken and eroded by the wind. Where nwind has partially etched them away, a { concentric } [ Concentric objects ] structure is evident. Researchers checked the nspheres composition by using an instrument called the Alpha Particle nX-Ray Spectrometer on Opportunitys arm.Squyres added: 'They seem to be ncrunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle.,They are different in nconcentration. They are different in { structure } [ Structure ] {. } [ Structure ] They are different in ncomposition.

We have multiple working { hypotheses } [ Hypothesis ], and we have o favorite { hypothesis } [ Hypothesis ] at this time. Its going to take a while to work nthis out, so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks ndo the talking.'Just past { Kirkwood } [ Kirkwood, Lancashire ] lies another { science } [ Science ] target area for Opportunity.The location is an extensive npale-toned outcrop in an area of { Cape York } [ Cape York Peninsula ] where observations from orbitnhave detected signs of clay minerals.That may be the rovers next study nsite after { Kirkwood } [ Kirkwood (crater) ]. Four years ago, Opportunity departed Victoria nCrater, which it had investigated for two years, to reach different ntypes of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger Endeavour nCrater."}]
